That came after he endured a number of frustrating drops from his pass-catching targets, an undermanned group due to Davante Adams (toe) not playing and Geromino Allison (concussion) and Marquez Valdes-Scantling both exiting at different points in the game. In fact, Rodgers' lone interception came after the ball hit the little-used Darrius Shepherd square in the face near the goal line and subsequently bounced into an opponent's hands. Overall, it once again wasn't a vintage Rodgers stat line, but his performance while working with an inexperienced and inconsistent cast ultimately helped move Green Bay to 5-1 ahead of their upcoming visit from the Raiders.",

Minshew has regressed to the mean after a red-hot start to the season, completing less than 60 percent of his passes in three consecutive games after establishing a 73.9 percent completion rate between Weeks 1 and 3. His 9:2 TD:INT ratio is impressive, but the rookie signal-caller entered Sunday tied with Kyle Allen for an NFL-worst four lost fumbles. That is one aspect that Minshew will need to clean up in order to give the 2-4 Jaguars a chance to creep back into the playoff mix.

He also rushed twice for seven yards and fumbled once, but the loose ball was recovered by teammate Jamon Brown.The 2016 MVP continues to light up the box score with 335 passing yards per game and an overall 15:7 TD:INT ratio thus far this season, but Ryan lost for the 13th time over Atlanta's past 20 regular-season outings. He helped lead the Falcons back from a 17-point third-quarter deficit with three second-half passing scores, but Matt Bryant's missed extra point in the final two minutes proved to be a fatal blow. Week 7 presents a promising matchup for Ryan, who goes up against a Rams defense that has surrendered 299 passing yards per game and an 8:2 TD:INT ratio over its past three outings.",

The veteran quarterback had his connection with Stefon Diggs working on all cylinders in the first half, hitting the speedy receiver for scoring throws of 62 and 51 yards in the second quarter. He made it a trifecta when he connected with Diggs again in the third quarter from 11 yards out to extend the Vikings' lead after Philadelphia had closed to within 24-20.

        "report": "Brady completed 31 of 41 passes for 334 yards with no touchdowns and one interception in the Patriots' 35-14 win over the Giants on Thursday. He also rushed seven times for six yards and a pair of scores and committed two fumbles, losing one.It was notably more difficult than the final score would imply, but Brady helped the Patriots to a typically robust margin of victory by the final gun. He did his part by notching multiple rushing touchdowns in a game for the first time since Week 16 of the 2011 season, going in on a pair of one-yard sneaks in the third and fourth quarters. The future Hall of Famer did go without a touchdown pass for the second time in the last three games, but he's now generated four 300-yard efforts in his first six contests of the campaign. Brady will look to do his part to keep New England's record unblemished when he faces the Jets in Week 7.",

The rookie's first two interceptions came in the first half in his own territory, with the second eventually leading to a Patriots touchdown. However, the third pick short-circuited New York's first drive of the second half at New England's 30-yard line, with Stephen Gilmore snagging a pass intended for Rhett Ellison. Jones was naturally hamstrung by the absences of Sterling Shepard (concussion), Evan Engram (knee), Saquon Barkley (ankle) and Wayne Gallman (concussion), which left him significantly short on weapons. Jones has now thrown six interceptions over his last three starts after a spectacular debut against the Buccaneers in Week 3, a trend he'll look to reverse against the Cardinals in Week 7 a week from Sunday.",

Things fell apart Sunday in Denver, however, as Mariota tossed two interceptions and completed only seven of 18 throws for 63 yards before being pulled from the contest in the third quarter. Mariota's tenuous hold on the starting job may have been aided by Tannehill failing to produce any points on four drives and capping the day with an interception of his own, but Vrabel presumably will review the film before committing to a quarterback for Week 7. Neither player would shape up as an especially appealing fantasy option against the Chargers in leagues that start only one quarterback.",

        "report": "Stafford completed 18 of 32 attempts for 265 yards without a touchdown or interception during Monday's 23-22 loss to Green Bay.Stafford got the Lions off to a hot start, but the fact Detroit had to settle for five field goals over the course of the game ultimately proved to be the difference in the outcome. Fantasy owners likely aren't happy either, as the quarterback had two potential passing touchdowns that rookie tight end T.J. Hockenson failed to convert into scores. It'll be tough for Stafford to rebound at home in Week 7 against a Vikings defense that has allowed the sixth-fewest yards per pass attempt (6.4) in 2019.",

However, he only exceeded a four-yard gain on three of his 20 carries and was held to a sub-4.0 yard-per-carry average for just the second time this season as New Orleans' battle-tested front seven snapped his streak. What's encouraging is that Fournette has averaged 24 carries per game over the past three weeks after logging fewer than 15 attempts per game Weeks 1 through 3. The receiving upside, too, is an asset for Fournette, as he has four-plus receptions in every game but one thus far in 2019, heading into a Week 7 matchup against a Bengals defense that surrendered nearly 270 team rushing yards to Baltimore on Sunday.",

With the ball at midfield midway through the fourth quarter, Lindsay took the inside handoff and was stuffed, but he managed to scramble out and find the edge for a gain of 30, setting up a field goal to put Denver up by 16. Lindsay has now scored four times in his last four games, with a pair of 100-yard outings. What's worth monitoring, however, is his role in the passing game as Royce Freeman has looked like the better third-down back.

Fifteen touches also represented his smallest workload of the year so far, as Sam Darnold's return opened up the playbook and allowed the team to attack through the air a little more. While the Jets offense as a whole now has a brighter outlook, Bell could be in for a tough time Week 7 against the Patriots' league-leading defense.",

        "report": "Ingram carried 13 times for 52 yards and a touchdown Sunday against the Bengals. He also caught two passes for an additional 22 yards in the 23-17 win.Despite a favorable home matchup against a poor run defense, Ingram managed a middling 4.0 yards per carry. On the other hand, Lamar Jackson experienced tremendous success as the primary ball carrier, racking up 152 yards and a touchdown on 19 carries. Salvaging Ingram's day from a fantasy perspective was a one-yard touchdown plunge, giving him seven rushing scores in six games this season. Ingram could struggle again from a yardage perspective next Sunday in a road matchup with the Seahawks, but he remains a threat to reach the end zone.",

Not only did he cough the ball up on Green Bay's second offensive series, but he then dropped a wide-open, 33-yard touchdown on the next one. After that blunder, he gave way to Jamaal Williams, who capped that drive with a five-yard TD catch. While Jones would re-enter the game and produce decent results, it was Williams who wound up stealing the show, finishing with 14 rushes for 104 yards and four catches for 32 yards and the aforementioned touchdown. On the back of a disappointing display by his standards, Jones will aim for improvement in Week 7 versus the Raiders, but it wouldn't be surprising if the second-string Williams earns himself some extra touches following Monday's success.",

Not only did the 23-year-old suit up, but he shouldered a heavy workload and played a big role in controlling the ball (37:15 time of possession) in an unlikely victory over the (no longer) undefeated Chiefs. Jacoby Brissett vultured Mack's only potential touchdown, but fantasy owners will find it hard to complain about nearly 150 total yards from scrimmage. The third-year back is picking up where he left off following last season's breakout campaign, as he now has 470 rushing yards (4.7 YPC) and two scores through five games. Mack's ankle will get even more time to heal up during the Colts' upcoming bye week before he faces the Texans in Week 7.",

Still, it was a bit of a surprise to see the third-year back receive just four targets one week after recording a team-high 16 in a similar game script. It's clear the return of Gordon has essentially relegated Ekeler to his primary backup role, with the shifty running back attempting just eight carries over the last two weeks compared to 56 in Weeks 1-4. That hasn't meant a significant loss in playing time however, as the 24-year-old is still seeing close to 65 percent of the offensive snaps each week, but the lack of carries likely hinders the type of upside fantasy owners might have hoped for after such an impressive start to the season.",

He watched on as Carlos Hyde dominated the touches out of the backfield, generating 130 scrimmage yards and a touchdown of his own. Johnson is a nice complementary piece of the offense, but he seems unlikely to make a big impact in next Sunday's matchup with the Colts if the rest of the team's weapons are active for the contest.",

Ty Johnson was the presumptive favorite for that role, but McKissic ultimately logged 27 snaps on offense compared to 11 for the rookie. While the absence of slot receiver Danny Amendola (chest) likely played a role in the distribution of playing time, McKissic arguably flashed more as a runner than as a receiver thanks to a team-high 26-yard scamper in the third quarter. Before we anoint him the Lions' new Theo Riddick, however, we need to keep in mind that Kerryon Johnson is the bellcow who logged 70 percent of the offensive snaps after commanding 75 percent Week 3.",

Freeman fans undoubtedly would like the sophomore back snap his season-long scoreless streak, but despite their body types indicating otherwise, Phillip Lindsay actually has served as the primary goal-line back for Denver while Freeman has been more effective in the passing game. In addition to being a strong blocker, Freeman has caught at least four passes in four of his last five games and his receiving yards actually helped him edge Lindsay in total yardage Sunday.

Specifically, after Jones fumbled and dropped a would-be touchdown on consecutive drives, Williams was put in the game and quickly responded with a five-yard touchdown. He then ripped off a career-long, 45-yard rush on Green Bay's next series, ultimately helping him top 100 yards for the second time in his career. In comparison, Jones finished with 11 carries for 47 yards and four catches on seven targets for 13 more. Given that discrepancy, Williams could very well earn himself additional touches in Week 7 versus the Raiders, but considering Jones still ranks second league-wide with eight touchdowns and is usually rather reliable, Williams' extra work should still come in a second-string capacity.",

He averaged a respectable 5.5 yards per carry and looked especially spry on a 17-yard carry, but he simply didn't receive the type of volume necessary to generate big numbers. McCoy's involvement was minimal last week, and although he received double-digit touches in this one, he is difficult to endorse for fantasy purposes as more than a flex option in such a pass-happy offense. Still, he should be among the team leaders in backfield touches Thursday against the Broncos.",

Mattison did have a trademark mixed bag of a performance for a first-year player, thrilling with a 35-yard scamper but also turning the ball over on a fumble late in the fourth quarter deep in Philadelphia territory. Mattison will look to build on his career-best day versus the Lions in a Week 7 divisional matchup.",

Mack will receive an extra week to return to full strength over the team's upcoming bye, so expect Hines to be limited to work on passing downs in Week 7's matchup against the Texans.",

Unless Hill can somehow overtake Gus Edwards for the backup role behind Mark Ingram, he'll continue to fly below the fantasy radar.",

As Sunday showed, Abdullah can help out a passing game that has struggled mightily this season, but, given Cook's abilities as the team's third-leading receiver, it's unlikely that Abdullah would get too much extra work even if the Vikings try to mix it up a little.",

        "report": "Thomas secured eight of 12 targets for 89 yards in the Saints' 13-6 win over the Jaguars on Sunday.Thomas wasn't anywhere near as prolific as he'd been at the expense of the Buccaneers in Week 5, but he was able to generate a solid fantasy afternoon overall versus a Jaguars defense missing Jalen Ramsey (back) for a third consecutive contest. Thomas once again unsurprisingly paced the Saints in targets and now has logged 25 looks over the last two games alone. The Pro Bowl receiver will look to make his mark once again versus the tough Bears defense Week 7.",

He stepped up again during Denver's last full drive in the fourth quarter, converting a third down with an 18-yard catch over the middle to set up another Denver field goal. Sutton has been Denver's most dynamic target this season with at least 75 yards in four of six games and an impressive 15.9 yards per catch. Emmanuel Sanders left at halftime with a knee injury, and if he's out Thursday against Kansas City, Sutton will need to carry the load.",

Prior to Sunday's dud, the 29-year-old had been putting up strong fantasy numbers with 20 receptions, 195 yards and four touchdowns in three games (he missed Week 4 due to injury).

        "report": "Chark caught three of seven targets for 43 yards during Sunday's 13-6 loss to the Saints.It was a dream matchup coming into Week 6 for the second-year wideout, taking on a New Orleans defense that conceded 125 receiving yards and two touchdowns to Buccaneers wideout Chris Godwin the outing prior. Chark himself had four-plus catches in every appearance thus far this season coming into Sunday, with one touchdown and nearly 100 receiving yards per game. The grizzled Saints secondary was capable of keeping the young wideout in check, but he has a strong chance of bouncing back in Week 7 against a Bengals defense that entered the weekend allowing 267 passing yards per game over its past four outings.",

He locked in a strong fantasy night early with a nifty 64-yard touchdown reception at the 6:05 mark of the second quarter, a play where Tate kept his concentration after initially bobbling the ball and raced down the right sideline into the end zone after securing it. The veteran pass-catcher displayed some solid chemistry with Jones, which was one of the few encouraging aspects of the Giants' three-touchdown loss. Tate will look to build on what was his first 100-yard tally since Week 4 of the 2018 season when he faces the Cardinals in Week 7.",

However, the most encouraging aspect of this game for Golladay investors is that quarterback Matthew Stafford repeatedly targeted the wideout despite having someone else seemingly wide open. This shouldn't be much of a surprise, considering Golladay has served as Stafford's go-to option since last season and the receiver has seen at least eight targets in every game this season. The Stafford-Golladay connection will be crucial to the Lions' offensive game plan when Minnesota comes to town in Week 7.",

The yardage represents a season high for the 23-year-old wideout, highlighting a disappointing start to his sophomore campaign. Pettis continues to start on a weekly basis, but the 49ers' zone-run scheme has left few scraps to be had in the passing game outside of the team's starting tight end.

Jones started the season off somewhat quiet, but has 178 yards and a touchdown over his past two games. He and Kenny Golladay are fairly even in usage through the first quarter of the season, though Jones fans would surely like a more even split in touchdowns, currently four to one in favor of Golladay.",

While a return from a four-game absence could still come to fruition, it likely will be contingent on Jackson practicing on at least a limited basis Thursday and Friday. Mack Hollins has benefited the most from increased snaps while Jackson has been out, but the enhanced role hasn't translated to many targets (12).",

This period should give Dorsett a chance to play Week 7 depending on how his recovery progresses. The Patriots' wide receiver corps are currently banged up with Julian Edelman (chest) and Josh Gordon (knee) both nursing injuries, so Dorsett's return would be a welcome sight. In his absence, Jakobi Meyers could draw more looks from quarterback Tom Brady against a Giants defense that has surrendered almost 280 passing yards per game so far this season.",

He also got involved in the offense early, registering a 13-yard grab on the opening play of the Titans' third possession. However, the end result was an uninspiring line, a microcosm of the team's overall passing attack. While Brown's role appears to be growing as his rookie season wears on, Tennessee rarely has enough pass volume to go around, particularly when Adam Humphries, Corey Davis and even Delanie Walker appear to be prioritized ahead of him in the passing attack.",

He didn't register a catch until the final minute of the first half but led off the next one with his long of the day, a 23-yarder. WIth Alshon Jeffery and DeSean Jackson (abdomen) both out early in the season, the 26-year-old shined as the primary receiver, but since Jeffery has returned, Agholor has just five catches and eleven targets for 62 yards. With Jackson a possibility to play this week against Dallas, the USC product's days as a starter are very likely short-lived.",

Although he failed to haul in a catchable pass on his first target, Lazard immediately bounced back, corralling an unbelievable 35-yard touchdown pass from Aaron Rodgers on the very next play, cutting the Packers' fourth-quarter deficit to two points in the process. After that contribution, Rodgers looked for Lazard three times on the team's final drive, which ultimately helped set up the game-winning field goal. Although the injuries to his fellow wideouts will be important to monitor ahead of Week 7's game versus the Raiders, Lazard surely earned himself some extra snaps with his improbable performance Monday.",

The starting tight end was making his return to the field after a four-game absence due to a tibia plateau fracture to his left knee. Henry was the primary beneficiary of a spirited fourth-quarter rally, catching three passes, including two touchdowns, in the fourth quarter. With the Steelers' defense hell-bent on stopping Keenan Allen, both Henry and Mike Williams received the largest target volume as the two combined for 19 targets, although most of that production occurred in the second half as the Chargers tried to erase a three-score deficit. While Henry isn't likely to benefit from that level of garbage-time production moving forward, the 6-foot-5 tight end clearly will be a major red-zone weapon moving forward.",

He broke off a 39-yard gain, which tied his longest of the year, and has now recorded 99 or more receiving yards in three of six games. Andrews also has three touchdown catches to his name and will look to add to his numbers in next Sunday's matchup with the Seahawks.",

Eifert garnered one end-zone target Sunday but was unable to haul in the pass, and he has yet to exceed 27 receiving yards in any game this year after breaking 35 yards in three of his four appearances during 2018.

Coach Adam Gase hopes Herndon can practice this week because he needs to shake off a hamstring injury before he can play in Sunday's game against the Patriots. Fantasy owners would be wise to pick Herndon up after Sam Darnold revitalized the passing offense with 338 yards and two scores against the Cowboys in his return from mono.",

Not only did Hockenson fail to extend a goal-line screen pass to the end zone early on, but he later dropped another potential touchdown in the corner of the end zone, failing to hang onto the ball after he hit the ground.

The result was a season-high snap share for Clay, who slightly out-snapped fellow tight end Maxx Williams, 44-43. Having said that, neither player has contributed much to the NFL's 19th-ranked pass offense, with Clay himself posting a 5-50-0 line on seven targets through five games.",

The Colts are a more balanced operation with Jacoby Brissett under center and were downright run-heavy Sunday against Kansas City, so expectations should be tempered.

That Sunday's three receptions and 49 yards both tied or set season highs is not great for Jarwin, who plays behind veteran Jason Witten, but the third-year player may be due for a few more opportunities.
