The Vikings typically want to run the ball, but they have the pass-catching talent to be more pass-oriented if they choose to make a change during their Week 7 bye.

Mahomes' two touchdown throws went to Sammy Watkins and Travis Kelce. Another 60-plus yards score to Tyreek Hill was called back on a Chiefs penalty. Mahomes was cruising in the first half, but Kansas City had fewer than 25 yards of second-half offense deep into the fourth quarter with the Raiders harassing Mahomes and making him leave the pocket on most of his throws. He had to contort his body to make a number of throws. The fantasy numbers look great, but Mahomes didn't play all that well, completing just over 51% of his passes. He could have been picked off a couple times as well. The 4-1 Chiefs will head to Buffalo in Week 6, a game that is scheduled to kick off early Monday night.\n",

    "analysis": "Jackson's Week 6 rushing output should be a relief for fantasy managers who have watched the quarterback average a career low 8.2 rushing attempts per game this season. Jackson masterfully manipulated the Philadelphia defense with ball fakes and option plays, creating massive running lanes that led to a couple long runs, including a 37-yard touchdown scamper. Baltimore's passing attack continued to struggle this week as Jackson has little time to operate in the pocket. He won't be fantasy's QB11 for very long. Jackson should remain in all fantasy lineups in Week 8\u00a0against the Steelers after the bye week.\u00a0\n",

Fitzpatrick rushed just one time for four yards. He looked like he was going to have a huge game after the first half, but it was still a strong stat line.

For fantasy purposes, today's game wasn't enough to move him outside of top-five rankings, especially with John Brown expected to return soon and the Chiefs on schedule next. That game should have one of the highest Vegas over/unders of the week. Allen will be an upside QB1.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Brady could have pulled up a chair and sipped mai tais as Tampa Bay's defense frustrated the Packers' attack with six sacks, six pass breakups and a pick-six, ultimately gifting the Bucs their fourth win of the year from the opening kick. Brady only had to manage this one until the end, rekindling an old flame with Rob Gronkowski (5/78/1) as Ronald Jones (23/113/2) bulldozed his way to his third consecutive 100-yard performance on the ground. Expect Brady to attempt more than 27 passes against Las Vegas' potent offense in Week 7.\n",

Ryan's best play was a scramble on 4th-and-1 that resulted in a flick to Jones for a 40-yard run-and catch. When Ryan, Jones, and Calvin Ridley are fully healthy, Ryan can be jammed inside top-12 fantasy rankings. That should be the case at home next week with Detroit traveling south.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "A new season high, the 364 yards were the fifth most of Tannehill's resurgent career. Tannehill did toss just his second interception of the season. He also lost a fumble in his own red zone moments after LT Taylor Lewan departed with a knee issue. Fill-in Ty Sambrailo got beaten like a drum by J.J. Watt, and Tannehill got crunched\u00a0on third down. Other than that, it felt like one big gain after another, including a pair of scores to A.J. Brown. Tannehill found backup TE Anthony Firkser for 8/113/1 after Jonnu Smith was forced out with an ankle injury. The Titans like to limit Tannehill's attempts, but he was more than capable of keeping up in shootout ball. After facing Romeo Crennel's swinging gate defense, Tannehill does have a much tougher Week 7 assignment in the Steelers.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

Their other trip to the end zone came on a fumble recovery that was taken to the house. Jones didn't do much as a passer but had multiple impressive runs including a 49-yarder that set up a Graham Gano field goal later in the drive. The Giants are on a short week now as they face the Eagles on Thursday Night Football in four days. Jones' ability as a rusher makes him a high-end QB2 but his lack of passing production greatly caps his upside.\n",

It was the veteran's second-lowest passer rating (35.4) in any game he's started as Green Bay registered\u00a0nine first downs on its first two possessions and only three more until\u00a0the time Rodgers was benched. Whether he was under duress in the pocket, taking six sacks from Tampa Bay's menacing front-seven, or forcing throws into tight coverage (allowing for six pass breakups and a pick-six), the fact is the Buccaneers' defense singlehandedly cancelled anything Rodgers could throw at them. He'll look to right the ship in Week 7 against the Texans.\n",

The Jets offered minimal pressure throughout, allowing\u00a0the second-year pro to average 10.2 YPA and continue his thriving rapport with DeAndre Hopkins (6/131/1) with ease.

He didn't do much of note before the final, game-winning drive when he hit Michael Gallup for a couple huge gains to get the Cowboys in field goal range. Dalton averaged a robust 10.1 yards per attempt in relief. He's no Prescott, but this is the best supporting cast of skill players Dalton will have ever played with, so maybe he can have some streaming appeal. The Cowboys host the Cardinals in Week 6.\n",

Burrow made a living getting the ball downfield to Tee Higgins (6/125) and on slants over the middle to A.J. Green (8/96) but ceded touchdowns inside the 10-yard line to both Joe Mixon (18/54/1) and Giovani Bernard (8/15/1). Sunday was still the rookie's fourth game with 300-plus passing yards in his last five starts. With volume both through the air and on the ground assured, Burrow will again rank as a high-end QB2 in Week 7 against the Browns.\n",

Wentz time and again looked to Travis Fulgham in the Eagles' frantic comeback attempt. Going for the tie on a two-point attempt late in the game, Wentz was tackled after a botched exchange with Boston Scott -- an inglorious way to end a comeback that would have been one of the most improbable in recent memory. Wentz profiles as a serviceable QB2 option next week against the Giants, depending on how many of the team's offensive weapons can return for Week 7.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Kyle Allen will get the start for a second straight week after missing some time in Week 5 with a shoulder injury. Alex Smith will back him up with Haskins inactive. Allen completed 9-of-13 attempts for 74 yards before leaving his game against the Rams. He struggled with interceptions and sacks in 12 starts with the Panthers last year. The only bright side is that he did propel D.J. Moore and Christian McCaffrey to career years. Terry McLaurin and Antonio Gibson are both worth starting in fantasy despite the questionable quarterback play.\n",

Jones' two touchdowns were also runs from inside the five-yard line as coach Bruce Arians continues leaning on the former as the team's bell-cow in this stretch.

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "It's, of course, possible Bell does far more than threaten CEH's No. 1 status. He could take it outright, though it won't happen in Week 6. Bell is ineligible to play against the Bills on Monday because of the NFL's COVID-19 guidelines. He will make his debut in Week 7 vs. the Broncos. Bell arrives as Edwards-Helaire has finished under 65 yards rushing in four straight games, failing to average more than 4.0 yards per carry in any contest since Week 1. Bell's arrival is particularly bad news since, at least in theory, he is also a well above-average pass-catching back. Bell will be a threat on all three downs, and it is up to CEH to make a stand beginning Monday against Buffalo. Realistically, CEH will probably begin in the RB20-28 range for Week 7, with Bell likely to get an immediate shot on early downs/in the red zone. It will then be a week-by-week affair from there.\u00a0\n",

Henry made a subtle cut at the line of scrimmage, cut back at the second level of the defense and then left the entire Texans defense \u2014 most notably LB Tyrell Adams \u2014 in the dust. Score No. 2 was a walkoff five-yarder in overtime that Henry took on a direct snap. Moments earlier, he added a 52-yard reception on a screen. Henry's only blemish was a number of screens where he could not quite hook up with Ryan Tannehill for what likely would have been big gains. Now with two touchdowns in each of his past three contests, Henry will remain a top-three play for next Sunday's showdown with the Steelers' elite run defense.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Hasty, who started the season on the Niners' practice squad, emerged as the primary ball carrier after Raheem Mostert left with an ankle injury. Jerick McKinnon got six carries against the Rams, but it was Hasty who was in the game when the Niners sealed the victory. Head coach Kyle Shanahan said \"Hasty was up for the challenge. Got some fresh legs in there and I thought he gave us some juice a little bit.\" Jeff Wilson was inactive Sunday night with a calf injury and Tevin Coleman remains sidelined with a knee issue. Hasty,\u00a0who recorded the best shuttle-time (4.03 seconds) of any back at this year's Combine, could be next in the revolving door of San Francisco running backs. He should be picked up this week in 12-team leagues.\u00a0\n",

Gibson will need to see a serious uptick in his role as a pass-catcher or runner if he's going to break out as a rookie. He currently projects as nothing more than an RB3 in PPR leagues.

Chase Edmonds received the next carry and exploded through\u00a0the middle for a 29-yard touchdown. Drake also received one target, bringing his total on the year to six, and looked every bit the part of his 3.2 yards per touch, saving his fantasy day with a two-yard goal line score. Edmonds, who got eight touches, has to be in consideration to overthrow Drake soon. The latter will be a usage-based RB3 in next week's contest against Dallas.\n",

His first touchdown was a one-yarder early in the second quarter he was allowed to punch in after failing on two previous goal-line carries. His second was a six-yarder early in the fourth. The big play was a 54-yard rumble in the first quarter where Swift was essentially untouched through a huge hole on the right side of Detroit's line. This is what Swift's fantasy managers have been waiting for all season, though Adrian Peterson remained involved for a team-leading 15 carries, one of which he converted\u00a0for a score. Either way, with Swift finally demonstrating some upside on all three downs, he is now a safe FLEX option. He will be a top-30, and arguably top-24, back for Week 7 vs. a Falcons defense that coughs up one running back reception after another.\u00a0\n",

Interesting strategy. \u201cI know there were a couple of opportunities that Perine will probably go back and look at and wish he could have that play back,\" Gase said after the Jets' Week 6 loss to Miami. \"We just gotta keep getting him more and more carries. Hopefully in the next game, we can get the carries the way we want them.\u201d Gase seems intent on Perine as the team's primary ball carrier. But as long as Frank Gore has a pulse, he's going to eat into Perine's workload.\u00a0\n",

He should only be rostered if holding out for an unlikely injury to Elliott.\n",

While that was not his fault, Moore also claimed a couple of drops throughout the game. While Robby Anderson remains a significant piece of the offense, Moore is starting to secure his spot as a WR2 moving forward. The Panthers take on the Saints in Week 7.\n",

    "analysis": "Hill looked on his way to a huge day with an early 60-plus yards touchdown catch, but it was called back on a Chiefs penalty. Patrick Mahomes took a couple more deep shots to Hill, but nothing connected. Hill has a touchdown in every game through five weeks and is a weekly top-three play at receiver, even if he's yet to have that truly big game. He gets a date with Tre'Davious White at Buffalo in Week 6.\n",

    "analysis": "Brown has racked up 674 air yards this season -- only Adam Thielan and Calvin Ridley have more. Brown, who has a 26 percent target share, is 20th in receiving yards and has just one touchdown through six games. Brown's downfield opportunities should eventually turn into fantasy production. Fantasy managers should try their best to stay patient with Brown, who will be a volatile WR3 play in Week 7 against the Steelers.\u00a0\n",

Despite his deep-threat game, Cooks' score was a one-yarder on 4th-and-goal with under two minutes remaining in regulation. Cooks also received a goal-line carry he failed to convert for a touchdown. Heating up in time for bye weeks, Cooks will be an upside WR3 for next week's showdown with the Packers.\u00a0\n",

His first was a 20-yard strike and his second was a 40-yard run-and-catch on a broken 4th-down play. Jones' reinjury risk is the only thing separating him from the other elite fantasy receivers. With Atlanta expected to play little defense and find themselves in shootouts, Jones has a top-three ceiling for the rest of the season. Hopefully his hamstring injury is behind him.

He now has 16 catches for 227 yards and two scores over the past two weeks. Those who picked up Fulgham on the waiver wire this week might have a plug-and-play option for the rest of the season. He tied Zach Ertz for the most targets among Eagles pass catchers against Baltimore. Fulgham should be in lineups next week against a vulnerable Giants secondary.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Engram has now been targeted five times in his past two games. He saved his fantasy backers last week with a rushing score but couldn't repeat that magic this week. The Giants' lack of offensive firepower under Daniel Jones has hamstrung Engram's fantasy output. The Giants have scored more than 20 points just once this year. Engram did see five targets in every game through four weeks before his recent drought. That volume should return and help him sustain low-end TE1 numbers going forward.\n",

From Week 12 on, Smith posted a 30-267-3 line on 41 targets, averaging 6.8 looks per game in that span.  Smith was a sixth-round pick of the Niners back in April and stands 6'5/255.  He ran insanely slow with a 4.92 forty in the pre-draft process, but perhaps the Giants found a long-term No. 2 to Engram.\n",

His touchdown came late on a sharp play design, one made possible because of Julio Jones' presence. Hurst arguably benefits with Jones in the lineup because he'll get softer coverages and Atlanta could pass the ball even more. The Falcons catch another awesome matchup in Week 7 with Detroit heading south. Hurst will be a top-10 option then.\n",
