Those turnovers were the only thing preventing KC from blowing out Miami in the first half. Even with his uncharacteristic mistakes, KC was up 20 headed into the fourth quarter. Miami's secondary frustrated Mahomes early on, pressuring him on nearly every drop back. That led to an unseemly 30-yard loss on a sack of Mahomes in the first half. He proceeded to shred the Dolphins in the second half. Mahomes will again be a high-end QB1 in Week 15 against New Orleans.\u00a0\n",

Vikings K Dan Bailey left 10 points on the board due to three missed field goals and a whiffed extra kick, but Minnesota didn't do anything on defense (especially sans Eric Kendricks) to convince they could have pulled this one off.

Nearly 73 percent of the team's offensive yardage has come via the pass, the seventh highest rate in the league. Buffalo's pass-heavy ways have led to Stefon Diggs leading the league in receptions through 14 weeks and Cole Beasley becoming a reliable fantasy option when healthy. Allen and the Bills pass catchers have a solid Week 15 matchup against Denver.\u00a0\n",

Derrick Henry's 215 yards rushing were the second most of his career. The Titans were up 31-3 early in the third quarter and spent the second half messing around. Tannehill's top play was a 37-yard touchdown strike to A.J. Brown on a flea flicker where the wideout made an over-the-shoulder, one-handed grab. Score No. 2 was a five-yarder to Geoff Swaim. Fantasy managers surely wanted more, but the efficiency on limited volume was more than enough to keep players in their quarterfinals matchup. Tannehill has another dream Week 15 spot in the Lions. He should get to attempt more passes in a game where the opposing team might actually score some points.\u00a0\n",

    "headlineNews": "Daniel Jones completed 11-of-21 passes for 127 yards before being benched in the Giants' Week 14 loss to the Cardinals.\n",
    "report": "",
    "analysis": "The Cardinals teed off on Jones for the better part of four quarters, sacking the second-year passer six times. Jones didn't do a great job of recognizing the pressure Arizona brought but his offensive\u00a0line did him no favors either. The opening sack and fumble of Jones' day came on a missed assignment that let a rusher get to him unabated. On the rare occasions that Jones got the chance to throw from a clean pocket, he was his usual, erratic self. He was pulled a few minutes before the final whistle and had a notable limp. Jones will likely start for the Giants next week but is firmly off the fantasy radar in single-QB leagues.\n",

It was still enough time for Wilson to\u00a0record\u00a0his 15th career game with four-plus\u00a0passing scores,\u00a0tying\u00a0Peyton Manning with as many such games through\u00a0a player's first nine\u00a0seasons in the Super Bowl era. Even Wilson's lone flaw, his\u00a0first quarter interception to S Marcus Maye, can\u00a0be thrown out completely since it was a 50-50 ball\u00a0lobbed to D.K. Metcalf (6/61/1) in the end zone. The Seahawks also had success on the ground, seeing both Chris Carson (12/76/1) and Carlos Hyde (15/66) average over 4.0 yards per carry before getting benched with the rest of the team's starters. It was a breath of fresh air for an offense that had struggled over the last month, and just in time for Seattle's upcoming Week 15 matchup against Washington's blitzkrieg pass rush.\n",

Listed as \"questionable\" with an abdomen injury, Newton was absolutely dismal in a non-competitive game, heading to the bench for the final 10 minutes with the Rams winning 24-3. Newton's surgically-repaired throwing arm/shoulder looked weaker than ever, with the veteran having to put everything he had into even short passes. Newton's interception was a pick six on a botched screen where Aaron Donald may have gotten a piece of Damien Harris. Presenting zero passing threat, the Rams teed off on Newton for three third quarter sacks. Newton could have made his night look better with a rushing score, but got stood up from the three and two-yard lines in the second quarter. Lucky to escape with only one turnover, Newton had the looks of a player running on empty. Speaking after the game, coach Bill Belichick did say he would be sticking with Newton. He has 10 days to rest up for an equally-foreboding Week 15 matchup with the Dolphins. Newton will be a zero-floor QB2 for that one.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "It was a highly unimpressive performance, one where the Patriots weren't offering much respect to Goff's play fakes. Thankfully for Goff, the Pats' slow defense simply could not stop Cam Akers, who dominated the game and took pressure off his quarterback. Goff's\u00a0interception came on a low throw that Myles Bryant\u00a0managed to wrestle away from Robert Woods. As is the case in most \"bad Goff\" games, he was lucky to escape with only one turnover. His two-yard strike to Cooper Kupp in the end zone seemed to be lightly tipped. Goff's rushing score came on a fourth down quarterback sneak. Whereas Goff was always unlikely to perform well against Bill Belichick, he has a much more inviting Week 15 date in the Jets. Although he has only two passing scores over his past three starts, Goff has partly compensated with two rushing touchdowns.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

The Vikings moved the ball well, pasting Tampa Bay for the most rushing yards\u00a0(162) the team had allowed on the ground all season, but Dan Bailey's three missed field goals and whiffed extra point ultimately ceded 10 free points in what should have been a closer game. Minnesota will now be forced to run the table against the Bears, Saints, and Lions (with a little help from the Cardinals along the way) in order to sneak into the postseason with a Wild Card berth. Cousins will again rank as a QB2 streamer in Week 15 against the Bears.\n",

Inaccurate and unsure of himself, Mullens has struggled in a miserable season for the injury-ravaged Niners. Mullens should be a superflex option next week against an exploitable Dallas secondary.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Trubisky has been a QB streaming revelation since taking back the Bears' starting job from Nick Foles, who was abysmal throughout his time as starter. He's ninth in passing yardage (776) and -- most importantly -- second in passing touchdowns (7) over that span. Only Aaron Rodgers has thrown more touchdowns over the past three weeks. Peppering Allen Robinson with targets, Trubisky has shown some semblance of a fantasy ceiling since Week 12. He'll be a streaming option once again in Week 15 against the Vikings.\u00a0\n",

Whoever got the ball last was going to win, and it was Lamar Jackson who set Justin Tucker up for the game-winning 55-yard field goal with two seconds left to play. (The Browns took a safety on a multi-lateral final play.) Mayfield now has back-to-back 300-yard passing games after failing to accomplish the feat a single time Weeks 1-12. He also has nine touchdowns over his last three games, and his brutal interception to Tyus Bowser in this one was his first since Week 7. Mayfield is playing his best football of the season ahead of the playoffs. His touchdowns in this one 21- and 22-yard hookups with Rashard Higgins and Kareem Hunt sandwiched around a five-yard rushing score of his own. Mayfield gets a tough Week 15 date with the Browns as a middling QB2.\n",

But the Bengals lost three straight fumbles on the opening three possessions, one of which was returned for a touchdown, putting the Bengals in a big hole early. Allen's lone touchdown was a five-yard, second-quarter hookup with A.J. Green. Allen has one touchdown pass in each of his three starts, so he's obviously well off the fantasy radar ahead of a Week 15 date with the Steelers.\n",

The increased receptions were nice, but they come just as Hill is likely headed\u00a0back to the bench for Week 15. It should be Drew Brees against the Chiefs in a potential Super Bowl preview.

    "analysis": "On Sunday against Jacksonville, Henry became the first player in NFL history with four career games of at least 200 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns. His demolition of the Jaguars leaves Henry as one of\u00a0seven running backs in league history\u00a0with more than 1,500 rushing yards and 14 or more touchdowns through 13 games. Head coach Mike Vrabel rested Henry in the fourth quarter; otherwise he might have cracked 300 yards. Henry's chance to become the eighth player to eclipse 2,000 yards on the ground could be fantastic for fantasy managers in the season's final weeks. Vrabel will almost certainly feed Henry even in lopsided games to get him across the historic yardage milestone. Henry just so happens to play three of the league's worst run defenses over the next three weeks: Detroit in Week 15, Green Bay in Week 16, and Houston in Week 17. He has a real shot to set the single-season\u00a0rushing yardage record (2,105 yards), held by Eric Dickerson for 36 years.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Akers' hostile takeover of the Rams' backfield is complete, as he out-touched Darrell Henderson and Malcolm Brown a combined 31-2. Pro Football Focus charted him with 55 snaps compared to Henderson's seven and Brown's six. His 194 yards from scrimmage were the 12th most by any player all season. Akers' impressive 5.9 YPC would have been higher if not for some brick-walling late in obvious run situations. Running through enormous holes, Akers had four runs of 10-plus yards. Not that Akers wasn't tacking on yardage of his own. It was a flat dominant performance on an evening where Jared Goff wasn't offering much as a passer. Coach Sean McVay has made a habit of throwing curveballs in his backfield this season, but this genie isn't going back in the bottle. Akers will be the leader as the Rams look to seal the deal on a playoff spot. The pathetic Jets are a dream Week 15 matchup, one that will have Akers in the RB1 mix.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

That changed after Gardner Minshew checked in for the final quarter and a half, though Robinson lost 44 yards and a touchdown to penalties. What might have been. Robinson's 67 yards were his fewest in seven weeks. That's how good the UDFA has been. Already over 1,000 yards rushing, Robinson will face tough sledding down the stretch in @BAL, vs. CHI, @IND. The volume will remain RB1 on a weekly basis, but the output could be more RB2 in this go-nowhere offense. Minshew's retention under center over Glennon would be a plus.\u00a0\n",

With Hurts \u2014 who also went over 100 yards on the ground \u2014 challenging the defense in ways Carson Wentz doesn't, Sanders became the first back to have a 100-yard day on the ground against the Saints' defense in 55 games. Things have a way of not going to plan with Sanders, but he will certainly be back in the top 18 for Week 15 against the Cardinals, and quite possibly the top 12.

    "analysis": "He caught 2-of-3 targets for six yards in the passing game. Jones took a long while to get going in this one, as the Packers curiously were featuring Jamaal Williams early against Detroit. Maybe the Packers are trying to keep Jones fresh for the eventual postseason run. Jones has at least 75 total yards in six straight games, but it's always disappointing when he doesn't visit the end zone. Jones gets a Week 15 draw with the Panthers as an RB1.\n",

He hasn't found the end zone on the ground since Dak Prescott's season-ending ankle injury and has just one receiving score in that span. It's notable Tony Pollard was right there with 13 touches in this one and caught a seven-yard touchdown late. Zeke narrowly out-touched Pollard 14-13, but perhaps his calf issue played a part. Still, Pollard looks like the more explosive player at the moment. Elliott will be a TD-dependent RB2/3 next week against the 49ers.\n",

He reached his fastest miles per hour (20.33) of his career on his 80-yard touchdown run per Next Gen Stats. With the Vikings and Jaguars up next, Montgomery can be confidently fired up as an RB1. He could be this year's league-winning fantasy back. Imagine thinking that after Week 3.\n",

Dobbins has double-digit carries in five of the last six games and has a rushing score in three straight. He'll be an upside RB2 for Week 15 against the Jaguars.\n",

Of course, he went through pregame warmups like normal, a sign that Jacobs was going to have his typical role. That's exactly what happened. Unfortunately for Jacobs, the Raiders were playing from behind for most of the game, so Devontae Booker was being subbed in on passing downs. Jacobs has had more RB2 games than RB1 games for this very reason. He'll be on the RB1/2 border against the Chargers in Week 15. You just might have to block him on social before starting him.\n",

His rushing score came from five yards out in the third quarter, and then Hunt smoked CB Marlon Humphrey off the line wide left for a 22-yard touchdown with 1:04 left to play to tie the game 42-42. It was Hunt's first real big game since Week 10. The rushing score was just his second since Week 4, and Hunt now has four receiving scores on the year. He out-targeted Nick Chubb 7-2, but Chubb continues to have the big edge as a runner, out-carrying Hunt 17-6 in this one. Hunt will be an RB2 with upside next week against the Giants.\n",

Look No. 2 was a pick six after Aaron Donald got a piece of Harris as he tried to leak out on a screen. Harris was finding some nice holes to run through, but the with the Patriots presenting zero passing threat, drives were impossible to sustain. There was also a scary moment late where Harris got shaken up in pass protection. He remained down on the field for several moments before heading to the sideline under his own power. That will be something to watch in the week ahead. That is also true of Sony Michel's re-emergence, as the third-year pro mixed in for 7/22. Harris will still be the lead back for Week 15 against the Dolphins, but bleeding any work cuts his extremely thin RB2 margins. Harris should be considered a low-upside FLEX for the fantasy semifinals.\u00a0\n",

His four totes were his second fewest of the season, though he managed only five in Week 13.

That would mean more plays and a better overall offensive environment for what will almost certainly be a shootout.\u00a0\n",

The Falcons' offense has basically gone off the rails in Julio's absence, with even Calvin Ridley being less efficient and productive in fantasy. With\u00a0Olamide Zaccheaus (toe) on injured reserve, it will be mostly Russell Gage behind Ridley, with Hayden Hurst hopefully absorbing more targets than he has been lately and Christian Blake/Laquon Treadwell perhaps mixing in. Seemingly truly week to week, Jones is unlikely to be shut down.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "The Giants' secondary was playing well in their recent games but the best corners in the league routinely lose to Hopkins, he was given space to work with on a number of plays. Hopkins racked up much of his yardage after the catch including 41 yards on a single reception in the fourth quarter. After being held under 55 yards in three consecutive games, Hopkins is back as a WR1 once again. He's an elite option versus the Eagles in Week 14.\n",

It appeared early on that Brown would finally post his first 10-target game of the year, though he still ended up stuck on nine for the third time. The yards were his second most while the catches matched a season high. Brown's score was a 37-yard strike on a flea flicker where he removed Jags CB Sidney Jones' soul from his body. In 1-on-1 coverage, Brown made an over-the-shoulder, one-handed grab. Just ridiculous from the league's pre-eminent human highlight reel. More volume would be nice, but Brown keeps having WR1 days on the looks he's getting. He has a dream matchup\u00a0for the second week of the fantasy playoffs in the completely defenseless Lions. Brown will push for top-three status in the Week 15 rankings.\u00a0\n",

Deebo Samuel hurt his hamstring during the team's first possession, leaving Aiyuk as the entire passing game. Deebo's injury is reportedly one that could keep him out for a while. Aiyuk, who came into Sunday's game with a 28 percent target share over his previous four games, should be in all fantasy lineups going forward. He's a WR1 play in Week 15 against Dallas.\u00a0\n",

The secondary bit on Jackson possibly running, and Brown snuck behind for the walk-in score. Prior to that catch, Brown had dropped three of his five targets, including a brutal third-down one from Trace McSorley when Jackson missed two possessions in the locker room with cramps. Brown is very boom-or-bust but gets a gorgeous Week 15 draw against the Jaguars.\n",

Godwin is averaging 5.66 targets per game; last season, he notched 8.64. Mike Evans also averages 14.2 fantasy points per game thanks to 11 touchdowns on just 51 receptions this year. Evans is on pace for 823.4 receiving yards after racking up over 1,000 in each of his first six NFL seasons, including three seasons of more than 1,200 yards.

Reagor actually led the Eagles in receiving this afternoon, but that did not mean much in a game where the rushing attack was front and center. Jalen Hurts' dual-threat should help open up Reagor for big plays down the stretch, but WR3 volume will be nowhere in sight for what is going to be a run-heavy attack for as long as Hurts holds off Carson Wentz.\u00a0\n",

His absence -- along with Jakeem Grant leaving the game with a hamstring injury -- opened up snaps and targets for rookie WR Lynn Bowden, who led the Dolphins with nine targets against KC. Bowden has functioned as the team's primary slot receiver of late. He would be an intriguing Week 15 flex option if Parker or Grant are inactive against New England. Miami wide receivers coach Josh Grizzard said Tuesday that Bowden now has a grasp of the entire playbook, which might have something to do with his increased usage.\u00a0\n",

The Colts should move the ball with ease against the Texans in Week 15. Pittman will be an upside WR4/5.\n",

Sanders should have had a second, 20-yard touchdown in the dying moments of the game, but Taysom Hill simply missed him in the end zone. Regardless of who has been under center for New Orleans, Sanders' production has been too sporadic to trust him as a WR4. That being said, it will be tempting for Week 15, where Drew Brees (ribs) figures to return for a likely shootout with the Chiefs.\u00a0\n",

Higgins' role has steadily grown in the absence of Odell Beckham (knee), and he's looking like Mayfield's favorite target. His 10 targets in this one led the team, and his score came from 21 yards out in the fourth quarter. Higgins will be a WR3/4 for Week 15 against the Giants. He could see a lot of CB James Bradberry in that one.\n",

It was one of the more impressive catches we've seen all year from MVS, who is typically a finesse, speed wideout. He really fought back for the Aaron Rodgers pass to score his fifth touchdown of the year. The Packers seem to prefer MVS over Allen Lazard as Davante Adams' every-down counterpart right now, and MVS is making the most of his looks. He'll be an upside WR3/4 for Week 15 against the Panthers.\n",

Sims has clearly separated himself as the No. 2 wide receiver in this offense. After Sims and McLaurin, Isaiah Wright was the only Washington receiver to see a target. Sims now has two games over 90 yards in his past five contests. However, he also a game without a target in that span. Sims is worth adding in deep fantasy leagues but isn't a reliable starter yet.\n",

Evans is on pace for 823.4 receiving yards after racking up over 1,000 in each of his first six NFL seasons, including three seasons of more than 1,200 yards.

Engram should bounce back versus the Browns next week but no Giants player is a safe option with Daniel Jones under center. As the safety valve for Jones, Engram has considerably more value in PPR leagues. He projects as a fringe-TE1 in scoring formats that give a full point per reception.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Predictably, the Eagles' quarterback change had little positive effect on Ertz's fantasy fortunes. In two games back from injury, Ertz has posted two catches in a Carson Wentz start and two in a Jalen Hurts affair. He was out-targeted 6-3 by Dallas Goedert this evening. Ertz will struggle for TE2 value down the stretch as he plays out the string of his Eagles career.\u00a0\n",

A near full-time player with TE Pharaoh Brown inactive, Akins had a painful day headlined by a \"dropped\" touchdown opportunity because he lost the ball in the sun. Akins' red zone opportunities keep him on the TE2/3 border, but he's blown too many of them to have any TE2 streamer confidence.\n",

    "analysis": "Olsen was given a 4-6 week recovery timeline when he was placed on injured reserve November 23. He could conceivably make it back for Week 15 or Week 16, depending on how the Seahawks handle the veteran's injury. Jacob Hollister, despite playing far fewer snaps than Will Dissley, has led Seattle tight ends in targets (9) since Olsen went on IR. Neither Hollister nor Dissley are ideal streaming candidates in a struggling Seattle offense.\u00a0\n",

    "headlineNews": "Raiders signed TE Jason Witten to a one-year contract worth up to $4.75 million.\n",
    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Witten spent 16 seasons with the Cowboys from 2003-2019. The most-recent version of the veteran TE wasn't all that great, as Witten set career-low marks in both yards per reception (8.4) and yards per target (6.4) in 2019. The fit with the Raiders is even more puzzling considering the presence of both Darren Waller and Foster Moreau. It's unlikely that Witten sees enough targets and snaps to work as a standalone fantasy option in 2020, but his presence undoubtedly lowers the ceiling of both Waller and Moreau.\n",
