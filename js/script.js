His 9:2 TD:INT ratio is impressive, but the rookie signal-caller entered Sunday tied with Kyle Allen for an NFL-worst four lost fumbles. That is one aspect that Minshew will need to clean up in order to give the 2-4 Jaguars a chance to creep back into the playoff mix.

The future Hall of Famer did go without a touchdown pass for the second time in the last three games, but he's now generated four 300-yard efforts in his first six contests of the campaign. Brady will look to do his part to keep New England's record unblemished when he faces the Jets in Week 7.",

However, the third pick short-circuited New York's first drive of the second half at New England's 30-yard line, with Stephen Gilmore snagging a pass intended for Rhett Ellison. Jones was naturally hamstrung by the absences of Sterling Shepard (concussion), Evan Engram (knee), Saquon Barkley (ankle) and Wayne Gallman (concussion), which left him significantly short on weapons. Jones has now thrown six interceptions over his last three starts after a spectacular debut against the Buccaneers in Week 3, a trend he'll look to reverse against the Cardinals in Week 7 a week from Sunday.",

Bridgewater will look to conquer the thorny challenge that is the Bears defense in a Week 7 matchup if he does indeed draw at least one more start in place of Drew Brees (thumb).",

Foster (hamstring) already has been ruled out, so the Cardinals may need to call up Justin Davis from the practice squad.",

However, he only exceeded a four-yard gain on three of his 20 carries and was held to a sub-4.0 yard-per-carry average for just the second time this season as New Orleans' battle-tested front seven snapped his streak. What's encouraging is that Fournette has averaged 24 carries per game over the past three weeks after logging fewer than 15 attempts per game Weeks 1 through 3. The receiving upside, too, is an asset for Fournette, as he has four-plus receptions in every game but one thus far in 2019, heading into a Week 7 matchup against a Bengals defense that surrendered nearly 270 team rushing yards to Baltimore on Sunday.",

It could prove difficult for Johnson to improve his efficiency in Week 7 against a Vikings defense that ranks eighth in the league with 3.8 rushing yards allowed per carry.

Still, it was a bit of a surprise to see the third-year back receive just four targets one week after recording a team-high 16 in a similar game script. It's clear the return of Gordon has essentially relegated Ekeler to his primary backup role, with the shifty running back attempting just eight carries over the last two weeks compared to 56 in Weeks 1-4. That hasn't meant a significant loss in playing time however, as the 24-year-old is still seeing close to 65 percent of the offensive snaps each week, but the lack of carries likely hinders the type of upside fantasy owners might have hoped for after such an impressive start to the season.",

        "analysis": "While it's true Singletary adds a dimension Gore lost years ago and the Bills will give the rookie his share of touches, Gore's rushing attempts have been managed at between 11 and 19 every single game without notable variance whether Singletary has been in the lineup or not. Singletary's future usage is certainly worth monitoring for Gore owners -- much more than reserve back T.J. Yeldon -- but for Week 7 the veteran Gore still seems like a pretty sturdy play. The Dolphins yield the second most rushing yards per game at 169.6 and have somehow allowed 180 points through just five games. Not to mention Gore probably wouldn't mind sticking it to his former team.",

Specifically, after Jones fumbled and dropped a would-be touchdown on consecutive drives, Williams was put in the game and quickly responded with a five-yard touchdown. He then ripped off a career-long, 45-yard rush on Green Bay's next series, ultimately helping him top 100 yards for the second time in his career. In comparison, Jones finished with 11 carries for 47 yards and four catches on seven targets for 13 more. Given that discrepancy, Williams could very well earn himself additional touches in Week 7 versus the Raiders, but considering Jones still ranks second league-wide with eight touchdowns and is usually rather reliable, Williams' extra work should still come in a second-string capacity.",

Though Smallwood will likely struggle to match the 4.5 catches per game and 10.2 yards per reception Thompson has delivered to date, the former still represents a much better option in the passing game than the only other healthy back on the roster, Adrian Peterson. Washington may still promote Craig Reynolds from the practice squad ahead of Sunday's game, but his lack of prior NFL experience is probably enough to keep him behind Smallwood in the backfield hierarchy.",

The veteran pass-catcher displayed some solid chemistry with Jones, which was one of the few encouraging aspects of the Giants' three-touchdown loss. Tate will look to build on what was his first 100-yard tally since Week 4 of the 2018 season when he faces the Cardinals in Week 7.",

        "analysis": "The breakout game the Vikings, Diggs and fantasy managers had all been waiting for finally came for the speedy receiver, who got his day off to an outstanding start by shaking loose for touchdown receptions of 62 and 51 yards in the second quarter. Just as important, albeit not as spectacular, was Diggs' 11-yard scoring grab late in the third quarter, which extended Minnesota's lead to 31-20 at the time. The targets, yardage and touchdown tally were all high-water marks on the season for Diggs, who also equaled the season-best seven receptions he'd managed Week 4 against the Bears. Diggs will look to build on his second 100-yard game in the last three contests when he tangles with the Lions secondary Week 7.",

Although he failed to haul in a catchable pass on his first target, Lazard immediately bounced back, corralling an unbelievable 35-yard touchdown pass from Aaron Rodgers on the very next play, cutting the Packers' fourth-quarter deficit to two points in the process. After that contribution, Rodgers looked for Lazard three times on the team's final drive, which ultimately helped set up the game-winning field goal. Although the injuries to his fellow wideouts will be important to monitor ahead of Week 7's game versus the Raiders, Lazard surely earned himself some extra snaps with his improbable performance Monday.",

This translated into a tough outing for Jones and it didn't help that he seemingly was the victim of an uncalled pass interference penalty on a deep pass down the left sideline. Not only that, but there seemed to be other times when he got open only for Matthew Stafford to force a pass in to Golladay. Clearly nothing more than the second fiddle among Lions receivers, Jones isn't a safe bet for a rebound performance in Week 7 against a Vikings defense allowing the sixth-fewest yards per pass attempt (6.4) in 2019.",

Despite seeing the field frequently, Kumerow was targeted only three times in the game, and had only minimal output. With the Packers on a short week, both Adams and Allison could have a tough time playing in Week 7, so chances are Kumerow remains in the starting lineup. However, with just four receptions for 28 yards on the season, and another pass catcher -- Allen Lazard -- bursting onto the scene Monday, it will be tough to expect much from Kumerow, even against a beatable Raiders secondary.",

The 28-year-old is known for his blazing speed rather than as a sure-handed receiver, and that weakness was exposed when he dropped a long pass that hit him right in the hands. He continues to start alongside Dante Pettis, but he is averaging just three targets per game, so he needs to hit on a huge play in order to provide fantasy value.

He was able to dissect a Cardinals defense that entered Sunday allowing an NFL-high 461 receiving yards and six touchdowns to the position, and in Week 7, he will face a Rams defense against which George Kittle amassed eight receptions for 103 yards Sunday.",

The starting tight end was making his return to the field after a four-game absence due to a tibia plateau fracture to his left knee. Henry was the primary beneficiary of a spirited fourth-quarter rally, catching three passes, including two touchdowns, in the fourth quarter. With the Steelers' defense hell-bent on stopping Keenan Allen, both Henry and Mike Williams received the largest target volume as the two combined for 19 targets, although most of that production occurred in the second half as the Chargers tried to erase a three-score deficit. While Henry isn't likely to benefit from that level of garbage-time production moving forward, the 6-foot-5 tight end clearly will be a major red-zone weapon moving forward.",
