The Packers opened with three straight touchdown drives, including a six-yard rushing score by Rodgers, but the Panthers' defense surprisingly locked up the Packers' offense after that, forcing a punt in six of the team's next seven drives. A major factor? The Panthers' pass rush, as Rodgers was sacked five times in this game, a rarity which prevented Rodgers from working his typical magic and find narrow passing lanes to rifle rockets into. Still, two touchdowns on a \"down\" fantasy day is difficult to complain about. Rodgers is an easy QB1 against the Titans in Week 16.\n",

Murray also joined\u00a0Cam Newton (2015) as the only players in league\u00a0history with\u00a0at least 25 passing touchdowns\u00a0and\u00a010 rushing scores\u00a0in a single season. The Cardinals stayed relevant as the No. 7 seed in the NFC with this win and\u00a0will attempt to tighten its grasp on a Wild Card berth in Week 16 against the 49ers.\n",

Considering the lack of weapons at his disposal, Watson has played as well as possible in three games since Will Fuller's steroid suspension began, though it has resulted in only three passing scores. He has added at least 6/25 as a rusher each time out, along with one ground score. Watson continues to operate near an MVP level, though it will be lost in the noise of the Texans' go-nowhere season. Get this man a competent coach and general manager. Despite his shaky surrounding circumstances, Watson will remain a top-10 option for Week 16 against the Bengals.\u00a0\n",

Mike Evans was also tackled at the one- and six-yard lines ahead of Leonard Fournette rushing scores, so Brady's day could have been even bigger. Brady's 390 yards marked a new season high, and he now gets a juicy Week 16 draw with the Lions, who Ryan Tannehill just blasted for five touchdowns in Week 15.\n",

He's second\u00a0in touchdown passes (10), and third in passing yards (1,232) over the past four games, most recently throwing for 297 yards and two scores against the Giants. He's emerged as a plug-and-play QB1 in a Browns offense that seemed intent on being a run-heavy unit in which Mayfield would be nothing more than a conservative game manager. Cleveland's dominant offensive line has kept Mayfield cleaner than almost any signal caller in the league: he's faced pressure on a meager 26.7 percent of his drop backs this season, the fifth lowest rate in the NFL. Mayfield and Jalen Hurts are superb Week 16 streaming options. The Browns play the Jets.\u00a0\n",

That's the third lowest rate among quarterbacks who have played at least half their teams offensive snaps in 2020. Roethlisberger, especially in recent weeks, has been wildly inaccurate at times, raising questions about his comeback from offseason elbow surgery. He completed just 52.5 percent of his passes during Monday night's shocking loss to the Bengals. Roethlisberger -- who has seen the least pressure among all QBs this season -- has been less than serviceable for fantasy purposes of late, scoring less than 14 fantasy points in three of his past four outings. The aged veteran won't be more than a mid-range QB2 in Week 16 against the Colts.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "With the Dolphins' skill corps severely short-handed and Salvon Ahmed returning, Tagovailoa was a strict game manager, completing zero passes longer than 15 yards. His interception was a poor red zone decision in the first quarter where he forced the ball to Lynn Bowden in the end zone as he was getting hit. Tagovailoa compensated by avoiding further cough ups and contributing three- and one-yard rushing scores, displaying a nice little shoulder fake on the three-yarder. He's up to three rushing touchdowns over his past two games. With DeVante Parker and Mike Gesicki hopefully returning for Week 16 against the Raiders,\u00a0Tagovailoa should have a little more QB2 juice for a plus matchup.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

Tannehill then kept it with a 17-yard touchdown run in the second frame before accounting for three touchdowns in the final quarter. Tannehill rushed for a three-yard score, hit A.J. Brown for a two-yarder, and then tossed a three-yarder to backup RB Darrynton Evans. Tannehill is just adding to his new career high with 31 touchdown passes now and will likely get some MVP votes. The Titans wrap up the season with road games at Green Bay and Houston. Tannehill is an every-week QB1 ahead of the Week 16 date with the Packers.\n",

Coming into Week 15, Brees had completed 73.5 percent of his attempts. The trio of touchdowns gave Brees a solid fantasy outing. His slow start, however, put the Saints two touchdowns behind the high-powered Chiefs -- a lead that proved impossible to surmount. Brees only targeted Alvin Kamara six times, a curious departure from his penchant for checking down before his rib injury. Brees should be considered a high-end QB2 next week against Minnesota.\u00a0\n",

Herbert's late heroics came after an incomprehensible fourth quarter where he attempted \u2014 this is not a joke \u2014 one pass as Michael Badgley missed his eighth and ninth field goal attempts of the year. Before that, Herbert relentlessly worked connections with Hunter Henry and Jalen Guyton as Keenan Allen could barely move thanks to his hamstring injury. It was a needed showing out basically without his best receiver on the heels of his recent slump. Cruising toward ending 2020 with the rookie touchdown record \u2014 he has already tied Baker Mayfield at 27 \u2014 Herbert catches the Broncos in Week 16.\u00a0\n",

In Week 14, Bridgewater needlessly hurried his offense to run a play on 3rd-down before the two-minute warning, basically wasting an important opportunity. Tonight, Bridgewater fumbled on the goal line while attempting to reach the ball over the plane. He also fumbled again later on inside the five-yard line, but the play ultimately did not count. Bridgewater simply is not skilled enough to mask earlier mistakes, and is now 0-for-8 on the season in game-winning drive scenarios. His play likely points to the team looking in a different direction when considering their future at the position.\n",

    "analysis": "It was easily one of Ryan's best games of the season, and he was able to pull it off with Julio Jones (hamstring) out of the lineup. The Falcons took a 17-0 lead into halftime after Ryan hit Russell Gage and Calvin Ridley for five- and 12-yard touchdowns before the break. But the Bucs dominated the second 30 minutes. Ryan's third touchdown was a seven-yard hookup with Hayden Hurst. He had Calvin Ridley for an open second score, but CB Antoine Winfield Jr. made a great play on the ball in the end zone to break it up at the last second. Ryan's 356 yards were his third-most of the season, and it was his first 300-yard game since Week 7. It's impossible to trust Ryan outside of two-QB fantasy leagues, but he should be throwing a ton again next week in a road date at Kansas City. The Falcons have no running game whatsoever.\n",

Goff looked like he was playing the 2000 Ravens or 1985 Bears in the first half, overseeing one three-and-out after another while turfing passes and nearly committing catastrophic giveaways. He did \"convert\" one, throwing an interception to a dropping Bryce Hall against a zone defense. Goff almost committed the exact same mistake in the second half, but the throw was a little too high for the corner. Goff was better after the break, but it was too little, too late for a dazed Rams squad, one that relinquished control of the NFC West to the 10-4 Seahawks. The 'Hawks now\u00a0\"control\u00a0their destiny\" for the division title. The 9-5 Rams would have at least clinched a postseason appearance with a victory. This makes Week 16 vs. Seattle a de facto division championship game after the Rams beat Russell Wilson's squad in Week 10. With the Seahawks' defense continuing to play better, Goff will not be all that appetizing of a streamer for the fantasy finals.\u00a0\n",

The also 1-13 Jaguars hold the tiebreaker with the easier strength of schedule. Jets fans will be aghast that Gang Green did not see the tank through, but truth be told, they did not play that well or aggressively. The Rams simply slept walked through a catastrophic loss. The Jets put the ball in Frank Gore's gut over and over again, and his 23/59/1 line was somehow enough. Darnold's score was an 18-yard strike to Ty Johnson on the Jets' opening drive where the Rams never accounted for the running back. There was a miscommunication between the linebackers and secondary. Beyond that, Darnold found each of Jamison Crowder, Chris Herndon and Breshad Perriman for 20-yard gains, but nothing longer than 24. It was mostly the same old Jets, minus no turnovers. It was not the same old Rams. The Jets close the season vs. CLE and @NE, with the Jags going vs. CHI, @IND. That is a distinct Jags advantage when it comes to landing, yes, generational talent Lawrence.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Coach Zac Taylor's plan of hiding Finley in his first start of the season worked to perfection, as the Bengals pounded the Steelers to death with Finley and Giovani Bernard as runners. Combined, the two ran the ball 35 times. The Bengals took a 17-0 lead into the half. Finley's lone touchdown pass was a 14-yard hookup with Bernard. Finley made some big-time throws where he took big hits at the end of them, but overall he wasn't asked to do much. On his touchdown run, Finley kept it on a zone-read, and the linebacker bit way too hard as Finley literally walked in from 23 yards out. It's unclear if Brandon Allen (knee) will be ready for Week 16 at Houston, but Finley won't be a fantasy option if he starts.\n",

Henry looked to be well on his way to another huge afternoon after capping an easy opening drive with a three-yard touchdown, but Henry never found the end zone again, as he watched Ryan Tannehill rush for 17- and three-yard scores before backup RB Darrynton Evans caught a three-yarder in the fourth quarter. Henry's ceiling is so high that 24-147-1 almost feels like a letdown. But he gets another juicy draw in Week 16 at the Packers. Henry needs 321 yards over the final two weeks for a 2,000-yard rushing campaign.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Jones added another 13 yards by catching 3-of-4 targets. A whopping 123 of his 158 total yards occurred in the first half, as the Packers absolutely dominated the opening two quarters and led 21-3 at halftime. Jones' day was highlighted by a 46 yard run on 3rd-and-short, where he hit a lateral hop at the line of scrimmage to tear through a Panthers defense that attempted to fill every gap. Jamaal Williams going down with a quad injury allowed Jones to hit the 23 touch mark, and he will once again be viewed as a strong RB1 against the Titan in Week 16.\n",

The Seahawks' offensive game plan was abundantly clear as the team rushed 26 times to Russell Wilson's 27 pass attempts. Carlos Hyde opened the second half with a 50-yard touchdown run, but Carson is still clearly the running back to roster for the Fantasy Championship among this group. Carson also had at least three targets for the third consecutive game. Consider him a volume-based RB2 in a tough matchup against the Rams in Week 16.\n",

Otherwise, it was an inefficient, unwatchable mess of a performance. The awful stat line is all the more remarkable because Jacobs actually uncorked a 20-yard run, just his second of the season. Jacobs thankfully has nine days to heal up for Week 16 against the Dolphins, but he will be a low-ceiling RB2 whose entire fantasy case rests on volume.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Outside of his lone 26-yard catch in the first half, Sanders was met up the middle by Arizona's front-seven on nearly every carry and was merely handed five touches across the final two quarters. That shouldn't overshadow the fact that he handled every single backfield carry for the first time all year, out-touching Boston Scott 18-1 on Sunday and 36-5 in Philadelphia's last two games with Jalen Hurts under center. Sanders has also logged 81% of Philadelphia's offensive snaps in both of his last two games. Fantasy players should look beyond the results in this one and fire Sanders up as a low-end RB1 destined to help take home Championships in a smash spot against Dallas in Week 16.\n",

Despite the \"what might have been?\" feeling, Taylor is now averaging 127 yards from scrimmage with four total touchdowns over his past four appearances. He is playing a gear faster, and looking dangerous at the point of attack. He will remain a locked-in RB1 for Week 16 against the Steelers.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

The adrenaline has worn off now, however, and Akers won't be available for the fantasy finals. The Rams will likely install Darrell Henderson as their 1A back against Seattle with Malcolm Brown very involved as the 1B. Henderson needs to be added where he was dropped.\n",

    "analysis": "Unfortunately, Gallman was committeed by the Giants coaching staff. Alfred Morris subbed in frequently and ended with more yards (39) than Gallman on two fewer carries. Even Dion Lewis mixed in on obvious passing downs. It's no longer a role to bet on for the November noise maker. Gallman could begin losing touches to Devonta Freeman, who can be activated from injured reserve at any point. The Giants will look to steal a win in Baltimore next week. Gallman shouldn't be counted on.\n",

Barber unsurprisingly came in on the goal line, punching in a one-yard run to bring Washington within two scores ahead of the final quarter, but it was still McKissic who was leaned on in the second half.

    "analysis": "Cleveland was missing their star right guard in Wyatt Teller and his backup exited on the second play. There were fewer rushing lanes because of it, especially against the big fellas the Giants deploy on the interior defensive line. Still, Chubb was a fine fantasy play after finding the end zone in the second half. When in good game scripts, Chubb has a monster ceiling. Things are setting up for a big week next Sunday with the Jets on schedule.\n",

The 26 touches were easily a new season high, as Cincinnati went with a Bernard-centric game plan featuring their running game. He and Ryan Finley combined for 35 carries, as Finley threw the ball just 13 times in a game the Bengals surprisingly controlled from start to finish. Bernard's scores were a four-yard rushing score on the ground and 14-yard receiving one from Finley where the QB was drilled on the throw. Bernard can't be trusted as anything more than a low-end RB2 for Week 16 at Houston.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Morris also said Todd Gurley's role has \"changed\" of late. Not that he needed to tell us that; Gurley, who the Falcons signed to a one-year, $5.5 million contract after he was cut from the Rams, has fallen forward for 60 yards on 23 carries in his last four games. Smith has run for 37/167/1 and 4.5 yards per carry in that stretch but has still offered minimal value for fantasy since both Brian Hill and Gurley have stayed involved in lesser roles. If this is Morris' way of changing the guard and seeing what Smith has to offer as a featured back in Atlanta's last two games, Ito suddenly stands out as an interesting FLEX and DFS option in an uptempo matchup against the Chiefs in Week 16. He'll likely make an appearance\u00a0in John Daigle's Waiver Wire column on Tuesday.\n",

Swift now has 30 touches over the last two weeks since returning from his concussion. Swift gets a tough Week 16 date with the Bucs but will be an upside RB2 for that one.\n",

Ahmed was a sight for sore eyes in a backfield that had been running low on healthy bodies. He keyed a 42/250/3 rushing day that included a pair of short-yardage scores from Tua Tagovailoa. Myles Gaskin's (COVID-19) likely Week 16 return will throw Miami's running back group back into flux for the fantasy finals, but at least as of today, Ahmed will be the best roto play. No plans can be made until we learn Gaskin's status.\u00a0\n",

Not that he needed to tell us that; Gurley, who the Falcons signed to a one-year, $5.5 million contract after he was cut from the Rams, has fallen forward for 60 yards on 23 carries in his last four games. Smith has run for 37/167/1 and 4.5 yards per carry in that stretch but has still offered minimal value for fantasy since both Brian Hill and Gurley have stayed involved in lesser roles. If this is Morris' way of changing the guard and seeing what Smith has to offer as a featured back in Atlanta's last two games, Ito suddenly stands out as an interesting FLEX and DFS option in an uptempo matchup against the Chiefs in Week 16. He'll likely make an appearance\u00a0in John Daigle's Waiver Wire column on Tuesday.\n",

For comparison, Adams produced 115 yards on 10 targets in Week 14. The Panthers' leaky secondary did a fantastic job against the Packers' passing game and quickly made tackles to prevent yards after catch opportunities. Plus, Aaron Rodgers completed just two passes that traveled more than 10 yards in the air on Saturday night. The timing is not great, but continue to trust Adams as a WR1 for the final two weeks of the season.\n",

Jones capped the Lions' first possession with a two-yard score on third down, and he later caught a 39-yarder down inside the five-yard line to set up a D'Andre Swift touchdown. Jones has seen 12 targets in three of the last four games and is averaging 10 targets per contest over his last six. If Kenny Golladay (hip) remains out for Week 16 against the Bucs, Jones will be a volume-driven WR2.\n",

He's only played in nine games this year and the Falcons are already out of playoff contention. However, Jones got a PRP injection in his calf which should expedite the healing process. He clearly wants to get back on the field but it doesn't make much sense for Atlanta to let Jones return with nothing to play for. The Falcons face the Chiefs and the Bucs in their final two games so Jones would likely be a borderline WR1 if he does play either week.\u00a0\n",

You would've thought Hopkins'\u00a0gloves were laced with superglue based on the catches he was hauling in, constantly being asked to come down with 50-50 balls in tight and, at times, double coverage only to win nearly every battle. The next closest on the team in targets was TE Dan Arnold with five. With 35 targets over his last three games, Hopkins is inevitably closing out the year the exact way he started it: as a matchup-proof top-five option.\n",

It was the longest play of the day for Indy. For whatever reason, Hilton drew to a targets standstill with Zach Pascal, something that is extremely unlikely to repeat in Week 16 against the Steelers. Springing leaks of late, Pittsburgh's tough defense is not enough to drop Hilton out of the WR3 ranks for the fantasy finals. He will likely be in the WR24-30 range.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Tonight had a little bit of everything for Agholor, including a quarterback change from Derek Carr to Marcus Mariota after the second series. Agholor caught a 30-yard pass from Carr and drew a DPI in the end zone on a Mariota target in the third quarter. He also dislocated a finger that had to be popped back in and endured a Mariota hospital ball that resulted in a painful ribs shot. Agholor is going to need all nine days between now and the Raiders' Week 16 game against the Dolphins to heal up. He will be more of a WR4 than WR3 for the fantasy finals.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Dwayne Haskins delivered a 30-yard strike to McLaurin (who was being covered with no safety over the top) in the second half, which ultimately helped the latter's final receiving line. McLaurin otherwise benefited from negative game script while Washington trailed 20-3 for nearly two full quarters, getting peppered the second-most targets on the team behind Logan Thomas (15). McLaurin has been involved frequently from Alex Smith and Haskins, but it hasn't amounted to more than 100 yards or a touchdown in any of his last six games. He should be downgraded to a volume-based WR2 in Week 16 against Carolina if Haskins remains under center.\n",

    "analysis": "Lockett finished with a team-high in targets (7-6), which can likely be attributed to D.K. Metcalf's absence for a brief period\u00a0with a hamstring injury in the first half.\u00a0More importantly, Lockett quietly reached 85 catches on the year, which qualifies as a new career-high mark. Seattle ran the ball 26 times (compared to 27 pass attempts), which sunk Lockett's and Metcalf's ceilings from kick-off, but the former is still the team's clear-cut No. 2 wideout. Even so, Lockett has now totaled less than 70 receiving yards in seven consecutive games and continues to plummet down rankings as a low-end WR2 ahead of\u00a0Week 16 against the Rams.\n",

Potential score No. 2 was going to put the Texans within an extra point of overtime, but Coutee never felt Darius Leonard thundering up behind him. Leonard punched the ball into the end zone and the Colts recovered with 0:19 remaining. That was that. Coutee has provided some PPR WR3 goodness since Will Fuller's steroid ban kicked in three games ago, but his Week 13 ceiling effort is predictably looking illusory. That being said, Coutee catches a gorgeous fantasy finals matchup in the Bengals. He will find himself in the WR30-36 range.\u00a0\n",

Samuel seemed to be targeted most when operating in tight formations or from the slot, and overall the Panthers' offense lacks pizzazz.

    "analysis": "Even at less than 100 percent health, Crowder produced his second best effort of the past two months in what turned out to be a stunning Jets victory. Crowder has the most chemistry with Sam Darnold amongst the Jets pass catchers, but that obviously is not saying much in this completely dysfunctional offense. Crowder will find himself on the WR3/4 borderline for Week 16 date with the Browns' pass-funnel defense.\u00a0\n",

This week was no different, but the rookie was able to find the end zone on a coverage bust in the flats. Mooney can make a big play here and there. He's just been held to under 60 yards in all but one game. His odds of eclipsing that mark are increased with the Jaguars waiting in Week 16.\n",

Will Dissly did not see a target against Washington. Greg Olsen (foot) returning from injured reserve in the next week or two would end Hollister's fantasy relevance for now. Even without Olsen, he's a borderline streaming option in 14-team formats.\u00a0\n",

He's still expected to be able to turn around for a portion of the team's offseason program since there was no structural damage found in his knee. It's obviously a long-term blow to the organization as Gilmore, who was shopped prior to the trade deadline, will have to make a full recovery before stepping back onto the field for his\u00a0contract year at the age of 30.\u00a0Veteran Jason McCourty will start opposite J.C.
