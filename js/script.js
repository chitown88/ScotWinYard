Just using everybody as much as possible, in all different formations and different looks and different tempos.\u201d Espousing balanced offense, Waldron wants more quick passes, featuring \"shorter and more horizontal (routes) than DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett have been running in Seattle for years,\" in the words of reporter Gregg Bell. For his part, Wilson is on board with all of it. More tempo and more quick passes would be a boon for Wilson both in real life and fantasy.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "What that means is anyone's guess. The Falcons are the only team in the league with one quarterback on the roster. As of early April, Fontenot and head coach Arthur Smith were reportedly split on using the No. 4 pick on North Dakota State QB Trey Lance. What Atlanta does with its first round pick with have reverberations across the league. But if they pass on a high-end quarterback prospect with the fourth pick, the Falcons could select a signal caller in the second or third round -- someone who could sit behind Matt Ryan for a year or two before taking over the offense. A QB like Kyle Trask or Davis Mills could end up on Atlanta's roster as Ryan's 2021 backup. Trask in 2020 was first in the nation with 43 touchdown passes and second in passing yards, behind Mac Jones.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "It's Week 1, but tonight will go down as one of the fantasy games of the year, with both the Bucs and Cowboys simply exploding the box score. The 379 yards were Brady's third most as a Buc during the regular season, though he has now reached that mark in three of his past four games, never compiling fewer than 348 in that span. He relentlessly worked his connections with Chris Godwin, Antonio Brown and Rob Gronkowski, and could have had an even bigger night had Godwin not dropped a 46-yard touchdown on a somewhat difficult play. Neither of Brady's \"interceptions\" were his fault, with the first clanging off of Leonard Fournette's stone hands and the second coming on a first half Hail Mary. The biggest play of the night was Brady's 47-yard touchdown strike to AB in the second quarter, where AB stole Anthony Brown's soul and Brady found him along the sideline. Brady's arm looked as strong as it has his entire time in Tampa. The man is simply a freak at 44 years of age. He's going to immolate the Falcons on 10 days rest in Week 2.\u00a0\n",

Once my shoulder was banged up and I wasn't trying to put myself out there and take those hits, we hit a lull. Honestly, I think it was a lesson for us. We can't be one-dimensional. We've got be better in all aspects of the game.\" Murray is correct that the Cardinals' offense went into a tailspin following his injury issues. It is more debatable if his legs can become a luxury. They might have to remain a necessity considering the way they unlocked Kliff Kingsbury's attack last season. Fantasy managers shouldn't worry about it too much. Especially as he remains in his early 20s, Murray essentially has no choice but to keep running as he hunts for big plays and tries to keep defenses off-balance.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Huntley toyed with the second and third string Washington defense through the game's final three quarters, continually challenging the secondary deep and connecting on several long balls. One of his four TD tosses was caught by rookie Tylan Wallace, who could have a role in Baltimore's offense if the team's starting wideouts don't heal up by opening day. Baltimore doesn't have to shift its offense for Huntley if he's forced to play this season -- he's a dual-threat QB who can beat defenses with his legs as well as a strong arm. Huntley should be rostered in superflex leagues in case Lamar Jackson misses more time with COVID-19.\u00a0\n",

Resting Stafford the entire preseason is bold given he's in a new offense and hasn't played a game with any of his receivers. Preseason quarterback injuries are also rare, with\u00a0Drew Lock the only quarterback to miss time, spending the first 11\u00a0games on IR his\u00a0rookie season.

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Making his first start following last year's catastrophic leg break and this summer's shoulder woes, Prescott tied his career high for attempts in a seesaw affair where the Cowboys never attempted to establish the run vs. the Bucs' dominant front. Prescott's arm strength was noticeably limited compared to his career norm, but it didn't matter as he displayed elite ball placement and near perfect accuracy as he found Amari Cooper for 13 receptions and CeeDee Lamb for seven. He looked like Peyton Manning in his post-arm strength prime, simply putting the ball wherever he wanted against an elite defense, albeit one that lost its slot corner early in the game. Presumably, Prescott's arm will also get stronger as the year wears on. 10 days rest ahead of Week 2 could not be better timed as Prescott prepares to face the Chargers. With the Cowboys' defense looking almost as bad as last year's version this evening, the attempts will continue to roll right in for Prescott.\u00a0\n",

After reluctantly getting the COVID-19 vaccine, Tannehill was removed from the COVID list after testing negative for the virus twice. ESPN's Adam Schefter said Tannehill is \"on track\" to start Week 1 against the Cardinals, whose inexperienced secondary makes Tannehill a top opening week fantasy option.

    "analysis": "Roethlisberger looked comfortable pushing the ball down the field which was a welcomed sight for anyone who saw him play last year. He frequently looked to throw past the sticks and even hit Diontae Johnson on a 43-yard strike. Both of Roethlisberger\u2019s scores went to rookie tight end Pat Freiermouth. Detroit will field one of the weakest secondaries this year, so it\u2019s dangerous to take away too much from this game. However, an increased emphasis on downfield throws would drastically change the complexion of Pittsburgh's passing attack. This performance should at least give fantasy managers the confidence they need to draft Steelers receivers at their current salaries. \n",

While Lance is expected to be ready for Week 1, San Francisco has treated Garoppolo as their starter for most of the preseason, and Lance didn't do enough to beat him out for the QB1 job. With that being said, it's unlikely Garoppolo holds the starting role for the entire year, and Lance would immediately be in the top-12 conversation for fantasy purposes once he gets the nod.\n",

While it's difficult to take much away from a pair of preseason drives, this could point toward Kevin Stefanski letting Mayfield throw a bit more in his fourth season as a pro. If the reports of the Browns loosening the reigns on their franchise quarterback are true, Mayfield could be in for a breakout campaign. He finished 13th in touchdown rate and adjusted yards per attempt last year but lacked the volume to make a major fantasy impact. If he takes another step forward as a thrower and Cleveland inches toward league-average in passing volume, Mayfield will easily pay off his low-end QB2 ADP.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Jones started the night on rocky footing, taking a pair of sacks within his first two drives. Left tackle Andrew Thomas was a revolving door, allowing anyone who wanted to pressure Jones to do so, but Jones also held onto the ball too long at times. He also gifted the Patriots an interception while on their one-yard line. Jones saved an otherwise dreadful night with an impressive two-minute drill to close out the first half. He marched the New York offense down the field before delivering a perfectly-placed deep shot to tight end Kaden Smith for a touchdown. This type of erratic performance should be the norm for Jones in 2021. He\u2019s capable of making incredible throws but will do so after a handful of crippling mistakes. Jones will be a frustrating player to decipher for fantasy managers but will manage to post QB2 numbers through his rushing production.\n",

He is also undoubtedly making his opinion known, and you ignore the owner at your own peril. Ross has always struggled to stay out of the Dolphins' football decision-making process, and his desperation to win a Super Bowl has led to many unfortunate, desperate moves.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Bridgewater's first test upon being anointed Denver's starting quarterback got off to a rocky beginning, going 1-for-6 for four yards during the team's first two drives of its preseason finale. Bridgewater fortunately picked up the slack for Denver's third possession, going 5-of-5 for 58 yards and an\u00a0eight-yard touchdown strike to Courtland Sutton to cap off his night. The 28-year-old veteran isn't an exciting selection, but he undoubtedly has value in SuperFlex leagues given the Broncos' projected schedule against the league's easiest slate of opposing\u00a0pass defenses. There's no need to roster him beyond that format.\n",

While Chicago head coach Matt Nagy is sticking with his pre-NFL Draft pledge to start Andy Dalton in Week 1, Fields will almost certainly see the field against LA. Fields' potential role as a touchdown vulture near the goal line makes Dalton an even more dreadful fantasy option against the terrifying Rams defense. Dalton should be considered a desperation option in superflex formats.\u00a0\n",

Wilson shredded Green Bay's second-team defense last week, completing nine of 11 passes for 128 yards and two scores. Though he hasn't displayed his rushing prowess this preseason, Wilson -- who rushed for 255 yards last year at BYU -- can and will produce on the ground in the NFL. ESPN's Rich Cimini said \"you couldn't ask for a smoother transition\" than the one Wilson has had this spring and summer. Wilson will likely be a solid streaming option in 12-team leagues this season.\u00a0\n",

Winston taking the Saints' starting gig will allow Hill to \"fill his valuable gadget/do-everything role,\" per NFL Network's Ian Rapoport. That, of course, could be an issue for Winston's touchdown upside if head coach Sean Payton deploys Hill near the goal line. Winston, 27, becomes one of the best late-round QB selections in superflex formats. His presence under center is a boon for every pass catcher in the New Orleans offense. He'll bring far more aggressive downfield passing than we saw with Drew Brees at the helm of Payton's offense. The Saints last year threw 29 passes that traveled 20-plus yards beyond the line of scrimmage -- fewer than any team since the 2014 season. Winston can earn up to $7 million this season in incentives, mostly based on statistical markers.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Evans, Downing said, has \"done a nice job with the wrinkles added in the offense.\" The team clearly wants Evans to be involved in the offense after his rookie year was all but wiped out by a nagging hamstring injury. While Derrick Henry is set for another monster workload as the Titans' early down back, Evans could squeeze some fantasy value out of a pass-catching role in a Tennessee offense that could be slightly less run heavy than we've seen in recent seasons. Evans is a sensible late-round pick for drafters seeking running back lottery tickets.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "By sending Etienne to injured reserve now, the Jaguars are making him ineligible to return this season. It is the worst possible news after Etienne went down in Monday evening's smackdown preseason loss to the Saints. It further clouds Etienne's future upside after the Jags spent the summer treating him like a pure pass-catching back, though Etienne is still five months shy of his 23rd birthday. He is obviously a strong hold in Dynasty leagues, one certainly worthy of \"buy low\" offers. As for 2021 re-draft, James Robinson is now the favorite for passing-down snaps in addition to early downs, though Carlos Hyde's between-the-tackles hand is strengthened, too. Laviska Shenault is probably also due a targets boost in projections, as well.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "ESP notes that through seven training camp practices, Sanders has narrowly out-touched Scott just 35-29 with the first-team offense. With Jalen Hurts under center, expect the Eagles to implement a run-centric offense, so Sanders should get a good number of carries, but it truly sounds like Scott is going to be heavily involved as the preferred pass-catcher and change-of-pace back. Sanders has dealt with injuries and can't be trusted for a full workload. Sanders is currently being drafted as a back-end RB2 while Scott isn't even being drafted in 12-team fantasy leagues. Rookie Kenneth Gainwell looks like the clear No. 3.\n",

There is too much at stake for that to happen.\" There's no way Montgomery -- who notched 16.3 carries a game in 2020 --\u00a0will see 20 totes a game, as only Dalvin Cook and Derrick Henry averaged more than 20 carries per game last year.

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "It would be hard for the Packers to lean on Dillon any less than they did last year. He topped five carries in a game just once, running for 124 yards on 21 totes in Week 16 versus the Titans. Still, the added confidence from his coaching staff is a good sign. Both Sirmans and Aaron Jones have noted that Dillon knows the offense much better entering his second year. Dillon's experiencing catching passes is almost nonexistent so any role increase will come in the form of extra work on early downs. Because of his limited skill set, Dillon projects as an RB4 with breakout potential if he manages to\u00a0steal away more work than expected from Jones.\n",

Chubb also led the league\u00a0in NFL Next Gen's rush yards over expected per attempt, demonstrating an elite ability to consistently succeed on his attempts. Literally the only weakness in Chubb's game is his receiving ability. His career yards per route run is just 1.04 and last year's RB27 finish was his career high. Kareem Hunt, who is signed through 2022 will continue playing heavily on passing downs. The league's most talented one-two\u00a0punch\u00a0is now in place through for at least the next two seasons.\n",

It's still notable that\u00a0McFarland, who was expected to operate as the Steelers' No. 2 running back, could miss a chunk of the season. That would leave Benny Snell and Kalen Ballage as Pittsburgh's backup running back options. With that in mind, it won't be a surprise if\u00a0Najee Harris handles 80% or more of the Steelers' snaps for as long as\u00a0McFarland is out of the lineup.\n",

It was the second week in a row where the Bills divvied up their first-team snaps with Singletary ahead of Moss. Confusing matters further, though, is that the Bills attempted zero rushes during Singletary's quarter. We would assume the duo's full-blown committee is here to stay, with Singletary the preferred option on passing downs and Moss getting the early-down advantage when Josh Allen isn't calling his own number. That will be a hard way for Moss to make a FLEX living.\u00a0\n",

His ninth round ADP in 12-team leagues means fantasy managers are bullish on his prospects as a timeshare back who could see goal line work in Arizona's offense.\u00a0\n",

McVay's comments are still a positive sign, in the sense that Henderson only needs to maintain a large share of receiving work and to mix in and the goal line to retain significant fantasy value. As long as the Rams don't view Michel as the clear-cut starter, the explosive Henderson can still be viewed as a viable upside play in fantasy drafts.\n",

With so little time to get acclimated with the team and its offense, it's hard to fathom Murray or Freeman will have a significant role against Vegas. Ty'Son Williams should operate as the team's primary ball carrier against one of the league's weakest rush defenses.\u00a0\n",

With a win total of just four games, the lowest in the league, this plan of attack seems destined for a head-on collision with reality.

    "analysis": "As was the case for most of Cleveland's starters, Hunt barely saw the field in the preseason. His two carries versus the Giants were the first and only touches he saw in the preseason. Hunt regularly goes as one of the final RB2 options in fantasy drafts. He stands little chance of realizing his full potential when Nick Chubb is healthy but still offers some value as a part-time rusher and Cleveland's primary back on third downs. If Chubb were to miss time, he would immediately vault to RB1 status. Hunt averaged 18.8 touches per game in four contests without Chubb last year.\n",

Zack Moss then got the entire second quarter with the Bills' starters, playing 16-of-18 snaps and rushing four times for 10 yards. It is the same thing the Bills did in Week 2 of the preseason. Singletary clearly has the passing-game advantage. It is more muddled between the tackles. In the red zone, Josh Allen will probably be option one for \"goal-line carries.\" Singletary is a \"better value\" in fantasy drafts, but it is hard to see either Singletary or Moss being a viable FLEX option on a weekly basis.\u00a0\n",

Arians has been brutal in his in-game punishment for any Tampa running back who gives up the rock, and there's no telling when or if Jones emerges from the coach's doghouse. The always-inefficient Fournette is Arians' favored back for now. Gio Bernard's near absence from the Bucs' Week 1 game plan could spell major usage for Lombardi Lenny next week against Atlanta.\u00a0\n",

No one's idea of an exciting fantasy option, Coleman should be considered in some deeper fantasy formats against the Panthers. Ty Johnson would likely be next in the pecking order if Carter's concerning preseason usage is any indication. NBC Sports Edge's John Daigle recommended Johnson and Coleman as waiver wire adds this week.\u00a0\n",

A wide receiver by trade, Patterson is no stranger to a utility role in the NFL. He most recently had 81 rushing attempts in two seasons with Chicago and 42 rushes in 2018 with the Patriots. A spate of backfield injuries in Atlanta this year could make Patterson the team's best option at running back.\u00a0\n",

There is too much at stake for that to happen.\" There's no way Montgomery -- who notched 16.3 carries a game in 2020 --\u00a0will see 20 totes a game, as only Dalvin Cook and Derrick Henry averaged more than 20 carries per game last year. The Bears would have to be a vastly improved team for Montgomery to challenge Cook and Henry as preeminent workhorses.

Edwards-Helaire had three carries for 13 yards and one catch for ten yards with KC's first-team offense before exiting with the ankle issue. If the injury lingers and CEH were to miss any regular season time, Darrel\u00a0Williams and Jerick McKinnon would likely split work in the\u00a0KC backfield. Since neither McKinnon nor Williams profiles as an early-down back, Darwin Thompson or Elijah McGuire could be in line for some sort of workload if Edwards-Helaire can't get right before Week 1. We could see Edwards-Helaire's ADP slip with this injury news.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "By sending Etienne to injured reserve now, the Jaguars are making him ineligible to return this season. It is the worst possible news after Etienne went down in Monday evening's smackdown preseason loss to the Saints. It further clouds Etienne's future upside after the Jags spent the summer treating him like a pure pass-catching back, though Etienne is still five months shy of his 23rd birthday. He is obviously a strong hold in Dynasty leagues, one certainly worthy of \"buy low\" offers. As for 2021 re-draft, James Robinson is now the favorite for passing-down snaps in addition to early downs, though Carlos Hyde's between-the-tackles hand is strengthened, too. Laviska Shenault is probably also due a targets boost in projections, as well.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "The Texans also have David Johnson and Rex Burkhead, who are likely to see work as well. With just five wide receivers on the roster, the Texans aren't built for high volume passing. Instead they're likely to\u00a0repeatedly run the ball whenever they have the chance. With a win total of just four games, the lowest in the league, this plan of attack seems destined for a head-on collision with reality. Nevertheless, the Houston's\u00a0offensive philosophy is likely to yield slower paced games that are far less fantasy friendly for opposing teams than in years past. The Texans host the Jaguars in Week 1.\n",

    "analysis": "McFarland has been struggling with ... something ... in training camp, having missed the final game of the preseason with an undisclosed injury. He'll now be out for the first three games of the season at a minimum. The move leaves Benny Snell and Kalen Ballage as the on-roster backups to rookie runner Najee Harris, who is in line for a massive role in his rookie season. McFarland was the only backup to see a meaningful amount of reps with the starter in the preseason and could have earned some work on third downs. Neither Snell nor Ballage has the pass-catching chops that McFarland does. His absence gives Harris a small boost in receiving production and keeps him locked in as a low-end RB1.\n",

    "analysis": "Bengals offensive coordinator Brian Callahan has been adamant that Joe Mixon will stay on the field as much as possible this season after the departure of pass-catching specialist Gio Bernard. Callahan, Morrison reports, could use Perine to spell Mixon so the oft-injured running back can get through the grueling 17-game season. Operating as the team's primary ball carrier for the final two weeks of 2020, Perine, 25, averaged 6.6 yards per carry. In a competitive Week 16 game against Houston, Perine had 136 yards on 17 touches. \"Perine has not only shown explosion and efficiency, but he did it behind a sketchy offensive line that should be a little better \u2014 possibly a lot better \u2014 in 2021,\" Morrison said. He's clearly RB insurance for Mixon drafters, and a sensible late-round target for Zero RB drafters.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "\"He\u2019s not just a receiving back, and he\u2019s going to play a lot this year,\" was Frank's observation.\u00a0\"A lot,\" he added for emphasis. Gainwell rushed 12 times for 67 yards (5.58 YPC) this preseason, adding nine receptions for 66 yards. Frank believes Gainwell has popped as a runner in addition to his expected prowess as a pass catcher. It would appear Boston Scott has serious company for the No. 2 job behind Miles Sanders. Gainwell remains worth monitoring in PPR leagues.\u00a0\n",

Gibson's usage in the Football Team's first preseason game wasn't exactly inspiring though. The second-year back started the game and saw no third-down snaps against the Patriots. Gibson was, however, targeted thrice in limited playing time. He won't require a massive increase in targets or receptions to prove a value in 2021, a year after catching 36 of 44 targets in 14 games (a pace of 50 targets in 16 games). Gibson enters 2021 with as much potential as any second-round RB to blow away his ADP.\u00a0\n",

He'll now be out for the first three games of the season at a minimum. The move leaves Benny Snell and Kalen Ballage as the on-roster backups to rookie runner Najee Harris, who is in line for a massive role in his rookie season. McFarland was the only backup to see a meaningful amount of reps with the starter in the preseason and could have earned some work on third downs. Neither Snell nor Ballage has the pass-catching chops that McFarland does. His absence gives Harris a small boost in receiving production and keeps him locked in as a low-end RB1.\n",

Especially\u00a0with Jones in the doghouse \u2014 again \u2014 and Leonard Fournette likely to join him there at some point, Bernard is going to have more prolific\u00a0games, but with so many Hall-of-Fame-type talents at his disposal, Brady isn't going to have to force looks to Bernard the way he did James White in New England.\u00a0\n",

Tua Tagovailoa and most of the starters played an entire half and Ahmed was a mainstay of that group. He saw 13 snaps to Gaskin's 19. Malcolm Brown, who started the Dolphins' preseason opener, only earned five snaps with the first team. There's simply no clarity to the pecking order in this backfield. For now, Gaskin appears to be the leader of a rushing committee while also\u00a0having\u00a0a stronghold on the receiving work. Ahmed and Brown will be in contention for backup duties leading into Week 1 if Gaskin holds onto that role.\n",

    "analysis": "Coleman's familiarity with the team's new offense proved insurmountable for Ty Johnson and rookie Michael Carter, leaving Coleman as the default RB1 headed into New York's Week 1 matchup against Carolina. ESPN's Rich Cimini said in June that Coleman has the most straightaway speed\" of any New York back, appearing to be \"shot out of cannon\" once he's made his cut in the famed Shanahan rushing attack. No one's idea of an exciting fantasy option, Coleman should be considered in some deeper fantasy formats against the Panthers. Ty Johnson would likely be next in the pecking order if Carter's concerning preseason usage is any indication. NBC Sports Edge's John Daigle recommended Johnson and Coleman as waiver wire adds this week.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Dehner notes that Chase strung four straight impressive practices together this week, which is notable considering his preseason struggles, and the recent reports that he could lose snaps to Auden Tate. It's important to remember that although Chase was the best wide receiver prospect since at least Amari Cooper, he is still just a rookie. At this time last year Justin Jefferson was playing behind Olabisi Johnson. Chase ultimately might not live up to his pre-draft hype, or he\u00a0may quickly emerge as a superstar. We won't truly have a strong indication which way things will go until the regular season begins.\n",

He may have sealed his fate Friday against the Colts, dropping two passes while securing one catch for six yards. The Lions will likely roll with Tyrell Williams, Quintez Cephus, and Amon-Ra St. Brown in three-receiver sets this season. St. Brown is a reasonable late-round pick in PPR formats. Perriman, 28 in September, could land on a practice squad this fall.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Moore was heavily involved in the one half he played on Friday, leading the Panthers in targets, yards, and receptions when he was on the field. The Maryland product has two straight seasons of almost 1,200 yards and has been one of the most productive wideouts in the game since entering the league. It remains to be seen whether the Panthers keep him in the downfield role (13.1 average depth of target) he was in last year or use him underneath more often, but he's a bargain in the fourth round of fantasy drafts regardless.\n",

Those absences have allowed Waddle to see outside receiver reps with the first team offense, and he has reportedly impressed. Waddle may also be involved in the offense on jet sweeps and screens. It was initially assumed that Waddle would see his work out of the slot in 2021. If he can mix in outside routes and designed plays, he could deliver a sensational rookie campaign.\n",

    "analysis": "Robinson is currently signed to the franchise tag, worth $18 million. The stud receiver has been pushing for a new deal over the past two years but Chicago has been unwilling to pay him top dollar. Assuming no deal gets done in the final hours of the extension window, Robinson will play out 2021 on the tag and prepare to hit the open market next year. The Bears could still choose to tag him again or both parties could come to an agreement before he talks to other teams in free agency. Robinson has racked up 2,397 receiving yards over the past two seasons despite slogging through some of the league's worst quarterback play. Justin Fields has the potential to be the best quarterback Robinson has caught passes from as soon as he earns the starting nod. If Fields exceeds expectations as a rookie, Robinson's value could hit a fevered pitch heading into the 2022 offseason.\n",

Chark suffered a \"minor break\" in his hand at the start of August and didn't play at all in the team's three preseason contests. In June, Meyer called Chark a \"big guy that played little\" last season. Chark seemingly has an uphill climb to relevance in Jacksonville's offense.\u00a0Chark was third in targets at least 20 yards downfield in 2020, trailing only\u00a0Calvin Ridley\u00a0and\u00a0Tyreek Hill, and only five wideouts had a higher rate of downfield looks than Chark. He profiles as a volatile fantasy producer in 2021.\u00a0\n",

There's still three weeks left until the games count and the Titans have been content to let him ramp up slowly.\n",

    "analysis": "Placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list a week ago, Crowder will be sidelined for the Jets' season opener against Carolina. WR Keelan Cole (knee) could be out too, per Saleh, leaving fantasy managers guessing as to who will fill the team's slot receiver spot against the Panthers. New York's target tree could be a narrow one, with Corey Davis and rookie Elijah Moore likely soaking up many of Zach Wilson's attempts. Davis, a target hog in limited preseason action, profiles as a reasonable WR2/3 option while Moore is a bit of an unknown after missing the entire preseason with a quad injury.\u00a0\n",

Dak Prescott's lone interception went off Lamb's fingers in tight coverage, while he also committed a few drops. His score was sensational, as he took advantage of a fake screen to run right by Bucs slot CB Sean Murphy-Bunting. Lamb was far less efficient than Amari Cooper, who hauled in 13-of-16 targets. He still offered more big-play juice, and drew almost as many looks. Attempts are not going to be in short supply in this offense, as the Cowboys' defense seems scarcely improved on last year's sorry unit. In fairness, it did have to deal with Tom Brady this evening. Both Lamb and Cooper will be in the WR1 mix for next week's date with the Chargers.\u00a0\n",

He then worked in 11 on 11 on Thursday with the first team offense on running plays vs. the scout-team defense. While this is a significant step, the wide receiver still has progress to make before drafters can be fully confident that he has recovered from the ACL tear he suffered last October. Beckham's\u00a0current fantasy ADP\u00a0assumes he'll be fully healthy to start the season, which appears to be the way things are trending.\n",

He\u2019s grown his game. Done this with a lot of players and everybody\u2019s on a different timeline.\" Gage didn't do much with his additional opportunity last year, averaging 6.5 targets and 11 fantasy points in the seven games Julio Jones was absent for. If anything, this news at least guarantees the former stay glued to the field across from Calvin Ridley whether Gage is in the slot or along the boundary. He remains an opportunity-based WR5 for Best-Ball leagues.\n",

Johnson could ultimately see the field if injuries continue to hamper sideline the starters. The Giants kept John Ross, C.J. Board and Dante Pettis on their final 53-man roster, a sign they may be worried about the health of Golladay (hamstring) and Toney (unknown).\n",

    "headlineNews": "Seahawks signed Tyler Lockett to a four-year, $69.2 million contract extension.\u00a0\n",
    "report": "",
    "analysis": "The extension includes $37 million guaranteed. It appears the team is committed to pairing Lockett and DK Metcalf for years to come. Lockett, 29 in September, is coming off his first 100-reception season, though his yards per target and yards per catch plummeted in 2020. He has been a veritable touchdown machine over the past three seasons, racking up 28 scores since the start of the 2018 season. Lockett proved frustrating for fantasy purposes in the second half of the 2020 season, when Seattle abandoned their pass-heavy ways for an ultra-conservative approach. Fantasy's No. 1 receiver in Week 8, Lockett was fantasy 24th highest scoring wideout in the final eight weeks. He shapes up as a slightly undervalued fantasy option if the Seahawks don't seek to establish the run at all costs in 2021. That's a big if.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Sanders was officially limited in Friday's practice with the foot issue that's plagued him for a month. There's always a chance Sanders, reportedly an ideal fit for Buffalo's offense and the likely WR2 behind Stefon Diggs, could be active for Sunday's game but limited to a snap count. His absence would make big-play WR Gabriel Davis an intriguing option in a potentially high-scoring game. Buffalo ran the fourth-most three-receiver sets last season, meaning Davis would see a good number of snaps alongside Diggs and slot wideout Cole Beasley. Sanders' availability will be worth monitoring for redraft and DFS purposes.\u00a0\n",

Although no discipline has been handed down by the league yet, these situations typically come with a two-game suspension. Harris, New Orleans' primary punt returner, was in line to open the year in the slot for Michael Thomas (ankle) prior to this news. Marquez Callaway is the next man up on special teams and will have no choice but to play alongside Tre'Quan Smith, Chris Hogan, and whomever else the Saints have available if Harris is in fact sidelined for two games. All are viable darts in re-draft leagues, but it's also possible\u00a0the Saints simply crater on offense with only Alvin Kamara available to move the ball.\n",

Despite these positive reports, it's hard to tell if the Eagles' are truly\u00a0excited\u00a0with Reagor's play, or simply relieved. Reagor struggled through injuries as a rookie and failed his conditioning test to begin camp. Early in camp reports also indicated he was struggling to stand out. Reagor\u00a0will need to build on his recent camp buzz, but if he does, the former first round pick has the requisite talent to deliver a true year-two breakout.\n",

Campbell reeled in six catches for 71 yards in the Colts opener against Jacksonville last season and it would not at all be surprising if he was in that same stratosphere due to the Hilton target vacuum. How exciting it turns out will depend on how well his recovery from the torn Achilles' has gone and how long he can remain healthy.\u00a0\n",

It was not an easy ball to track, but it was the sort of reception he usually makes. Nevertheless, both Godwin's grabs and targets led the team, though Antonio Brown took the yardage crown with 121, while Rob Gronkowski found the end zone twice. For Godwin's five-yard score in the first quarter, he went in motion before the snap and easily freed himself over the middle of the field.\u00a0AB and Mike Evans' presence will make for some inconsistency, but Godwin is simply too good of a fit with Tom Brady's skill-set to fall out of the top 18 in fantasy. The Falcons' pathetic defense is on deck for Week 2.\u00a0\n",

Pittsburgh\u2019s third-round pick last season, 2020 was already Johnson\u2019s second time to lead his team in receiving in as many years. His opportunities through the air ranked eighth in the league, falling 22 shy of Stefon Diggs\u2019 NFL-leading mark (166). With JuJu Smith-Schuster set to hit the market as an unrestricted free agent, Johnson is a terrific bet to again lead the Steelers in targets across from Chase Claypool in 2021. Ben Roethlisberger\u2019s contract, which the organization could choose to part with this spring, will ultimately dictate how high Johnson should be valued in offseason fantasy drafts.\n",

If the 49ers are giving him any number of reps in a preseason game, his glute is a non-issue. Samuel has suffered a number of injuries since entering the league two years ago. If Samuel is past the glute injury, he should have no problem reaching the regular season at full health. Going far later in drafts than Brandon Aiyuk, Samuel is a sneaky way to buy into the San Francisco offense in fantasy drafts.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Johnson had been talked up as a potential fourth receiver option for the Jaguars in camp, but\u00a0the 6'\"6/220 second-year wide receiver was a surprise cut Tuesday. He lands in a crowded situation in New York with Kenny Golladay, Darius Slayton, Sterling Shepard and Kadarius Toney all likely to have sizable roles in 2021. Johnson could ultimately see the field if injuries continue to hamper sideline the starters. The Giants kept John Ross, C.J. Board and Dante Pettis on their final 53-man roster, a sign they may be worried about the health of Golladay (hamstring) and Toney (unknown).\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Dehner notes that Chase strung four straight impressive practices together this week, which is notable considering his preseason struggles, and the recent reports that he could lose snaps to Auden Tate. It's important to remember that although Chase was the best wide receiver prospect since at least Amari Cooper, he is still just a rookie. At this time last year Justin Jefferson was playing behind Olabisi Johnson. Chase ultimately might not live up to his pre-draft hype, or he\u00a0may quickly emerge as a superstar. We won't truly have a strong indication which way things will go until the regular season begins.\n",

Doubling that number would be nice as a way to get the ball in the playmaker's hands more in year two. Getting tougher will also help in the short passing game; Ruggs has no choice but to be better there because Derek Carr refuses to throw the ball deep. Ruggs is Vegas' No. 1 receiver and is a worthwhile flier in the mid-to-late rounds of fantasy drafts.\n",

Cooper's 13-of-16 target conversion was compared to 7-of-15 for CeeDee Lamb, though the prodigiously-talented sophomore also stacked up 7/104/1. Cooper's first score was a five-yarder where Prescott found him with some cushion at the front end of the end zone. The second was a 21-yarder in the third quarter where Coop took Ross Cockrell to school, humiliating him near the goal line. Tonight was essentially a shot-for-shot remake of the Cowboys' 2020, with the defense failing to enter the same area code as Tom Brady and Prescott needing to pile up attempts on offense. We would have to imagine things unfold much the same way in Week 2 against the Chargers, putting Cooper firmly in the WR1 mix.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

He'll miss at least the first three games of the season. With his 2021 campaign already heading in the wrong direction, it looks like the Harry experiment is nearly at its conclusion. The Pats will move forward with Jakobi Meyers and Nelson Agholor as starters, and Kendrick Bourne may be the main beneficiary of Harry's vacated snaps.\u00a0\n",

It's important to remember that although Chase was the best wide receiver prospect since at least Amari Cooper, he is still just a rookie. At this time last year Justin Jefferson was playing behind Olabisi Johnson. Chase ultimately might not live up to his pre-draft hype, or he\u00a0may quickly emerge as a superstar. We won't truly have a strong indication which way things will go until the regular season begins.\n",

Callahan, meanwhile, has a strange fascination with five Bengals pass catchers recording 50 grabs this season. The Athletic's Jay Morrison said Joe Burrow \"established an immediate connection\" with Uzomah in 2020, as the tight end saw five targets in Week 1 and six looks in Week 2 before going down with a season-ending Achilles injury in the first half. Drew Sample started the rest of the season for Cincinnati and ran the 12th most tight end routes on his way to a miserable 4.9 PPR points per game. Uzomah, 28, has been fully cleared and is expected to be a full go for training camp. He should be a popular late-round target in the Bengals' pass-heavy offense.\u00a0\n",

New England should be among the league leaders in two tight end sets this season, making both Henry and Smith viable fantasy options in 12 and 14-team formats. Smith on Monday said he and Henry are \"two alpha males\" pushing each other on the practice field and the weight room. Adjust your ranks.\u00a0\n",

Score No. 1 was a two-yarder where Gronk leaked out for an end zone grab. No. 2 was an 11-yarder where Gronk ran free against zero coverage. It could have been our imagination, but Gronk seemed to have a little more life in his legs than he did in 2020. Playing in one of the most loaded offenses\u00a0of all time, Gronk will never again approach his Patriots ceiling and consistency, but it is possible he gets in the TE1 mix.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Smith's recovery timetable is four to five months, which puts his entire 2021 season in doubt. Behind Smith, backup Tyler Conklin has recovered from his hamstring injury and set to play in Week 1. Conklin has a career yards per route run of just 1.0, and is unlikely to deliver a strong fantasy season unless he monopolizes tight end snaps. Conklin's chances of doing that took a big hit when the Vikings traded for Chris Herndon Tuesday. The\u00a0former Jet looked like an emerging star as a rookie in 2018. He was then abysmal in his two seasons under Adam Gase, as is customary. If Herndon can recapture his early career form, the pass-catching tight end could be improbably fantasy relevant this season.\n",

Kaye deemed the Chargers an ideal trading partner for the Eagles because it would send Ertz to the AFC and to his home state of California. Kaye said the Eagles could probably get a late-round draft pick in exchange for Ertz, 30, whose 2021 cap hit is $12.72 million. LA has almost $20 million in cap space. Ertz ending up with the Bolts would sink Jared Cook's and Donald Parham's 2021 fantasy prospects. Dallas Goedert would likely see an uptick in targets with Ertz gone. The Eagles play the Chargers in Week 9.\n",

With an improved surrounding cast, the arrow is up on Andrews, who should flirt with double-digit touchdowns.\n",

New England should be among the league leaders in two tight end sets this season, making both Henry and Smith viable fantasy options in 12 and 14-team formats. Smith on Monday said he and Henry are \"two alpha males\" pushing each other on the practice field and the weight room. Adjust your ranks.\u00a0\n",

They don't\u00a0have any proven\u00a0slot options with Anthony Miller (shoulder) sidelined and\u00a0Keke Coutee and Erickson\u00a0both released. Chris Conley figures to see the the majority of snaps in\u00a0three-wide sets, but\u00a0Culley's comment suggests a potential role for fifth-round TE Brevin Jordan, who\u00a0played 62% of snaps out of the slot his junior year. The Texans used 12 personnel at the league\u2019s fifth-highest rate in 2020 and are expected to remain TE-heavy in\u00a0OC Tim Kelly's first year as a playcaller.\n",

Ertz staying with the Eagles takes the shine off Goedert, who profiled as a potentially elite fantasy producer if Ertz had departed. There's little reason to believe Goedert -- the seventh tight end off the draft board -- will have a significant target edge on Ertz in 2021, making the latter a far better fantasy pick considering ADP.\u00a0\n",

The continued drumbeat on Granson makes him a very intriguing dynasty target. In 2021\u00a0though, Colts split\u00a0snaps and blocking commitments\u00a0will likely limit all three tight ends to bye week fill-in options and cheap DFS punt plays.\n",

Far from a traditional rookie tight end who needs time to acclimate to the pros, Pitts will likely be used as more of a wideout, as he was during his dominant collegiate career. Smith said Pitts -- who has yet to take a preseason snap -- is \"right on schedule\" in learning the offense and his prominent place in it. Fantasy managers should pounce on Pitts if he falls below his fourth round ADP in 12-team formats.\u00a0\n",

He has a career 9.2\u00a0yards per target average and quietly had 438 receiving yards as a part-timer with the Cardinals last year. Only 26 years old, Arnold has some deep-league sleeper appeal as the Panthers' top receiving option at the position. Ian Thomas, who only had 145 yards as the Panthers' tight end last year, will likely head into a backup role.\n",

The rookie made a leaping grab at the back of the end zone to secure his second touchdown of the night. Ebron improved throughout the night but his time in Pittsburgh has been fraught with drops. If Freiermuth opens the year getting red zone work and proves to have better hands, he could push Ebron out of the starting lineup by the end of his rookie season. None of the Steelers' tight ends warrant consideration in fantasy leagues for now.\n",

    "analysis": "Smith, of course, is entering his first year as Atlanta's head coach after coordinating Tennessee's offense for two seasons. The lack of a dominant rusher like Derrick Henry was always going to factor in to how Smith runs the Falcons offense. McDonald said the addition of phenom TE Kyle Pitts could lead to more two-tight end sets for Atlanta after Smith's Titans were fourth in the number of drop backs with two tight ends on the field in 2020. That would mean incumbent tight end Hayden Hurst could still play significant snaps, though it's unlikely he'll get anywhere close to the 88 targets he saw last year. Smith, McDonald said, would likely change the way the tight end operates in his offense after using Jonnu Smith on short routes in Tennessee. McDonald expects Pitts to be used as more of a seam buster who can take advantage of single coverage from secondaries grappling with the Falcons' dangerous pass catchers. Already the fourth tight end off the draft board, Pitts could have a head-spinning ADP by August.\u00a0\n",

Callahan, meanwhile, has a strange fascination with five Bengals pass catchers recording 50 grabs this season. The Athletic's Jay Morrison said Joe Burrow \"established an immediate connection\" with Uzomah in 2020, as the tight end saw five targets in Week 1 and six looks in Week 2 before going down with a season-ending Achilles injury in the first half. Drew Sample started the rest of the season for Cincinnati and ran the 12th most tight end routes on his way to a miserable 4.9 PPR points per game. Uzomah, 28, has been fully cleared and is expected to be a full go for training camp. He should be a popular late-round target in the Bengals' pass-heavy offense.\u00a0\n",

Ertz staying with the Eagles takes the shine off Goedert, who profiled as a potentially elite fantasy producer if Ertz had departed. There's little reason to believe Goedert -- the seventh tight end off the draft board -- will have a significant target edge on Ertz in 2021, making the latter a far better fantasy pick considering ADP.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Hopkins (6\u20194/241) was a three-year starter at Purdue who posted a 61-830-7 season as a redshirt senior. Undersized and a below-average blocker, Hopkins will be competing for pass-catching reps at the NFL as a slot tight end or H-back. On tape, he showed burst off the line of scrimmage and created separation with route running and timing, but he was not a fully polished player despite being older. He dropped 22 passes during his career, including eight last season, and only broke 10 tackles on 130 career receptions. His 4.66 speed allows him to win on vertical routes and crosses against slower defenders, but he\u2019s unlikely to be a consistent in-traffic player. A 23-year-old rookie, Hopkins profiles as a specialist\u00a0between the 20s as a quick but undersized pass-catching tight end. The Rams have a loaded tight end room with Tyler Higbee and Gerald Everett, so it will be difficult for Hopkins to find playing time on offense early on.\n",

    "analysis": "Kmet started his debut campaign slowly, failing to surpass two receptions in a single game until Week 12. However, unlike most rookie tight ends, Kmet became heavily involved in Chicago's offense by the end of his first season. He tallied 30 targets over his final six games and began pushing Jimmy Graham out of the rotation. Kmet makes for an interesting late-round pick in fantasy drafts but relying on him to be an immediate contributor may be asking too much. Unless Graham disappears entirely, Kmet will be capped at TE2 numbers.\n",

    "headlineNews": "The Orange County Register's Gilbert Manzano expects Chargers TE Donald Parham to see an expanded role on offense this season.\n",
    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Parham, who stands at 6-foot-8, appeared in 13 games for the Bolts last season but was mainly used as a red-zone specialist on jump balls. He turned his 20 targets into an impressive 10-159-3 line but used the offseason to hone his skills. Coaches and teammates have noticed his route running has sharpened up, and the Chargers are working to get the ball in Parham's hands more in the open field this summer. Parham has been running with the first-team offense and even spent part of the offseason working out with Justin Herbert to improve their chemistry. With Hunter Henry gone, Parham has a real chance to make some noise in the passing game and red zone. Jared Cook was signed as a veteran option, but he's 34. Parham turns 24 in two weeks. He's a name to remember.\n",

The continued drumbeat on Granson makes him a very intriguing dynasty target.

However, unlike most rookie tight ends, Kmet became heavily involved in Chicago's offense by the end of his first season. He tallied 30 targets over his final six games and began pushing Jimmy Graham out of the rotation. Kmet makes for an interesting late-round pick in fantasy drafts but relying on him to be an immediate contributor may be asking too much. Unless Graham disappears entirely, Kmet will be capped at TE2 numbers.\n",

    "analysis": "We've come a long way from Hollister potentially taking Dawson Knox's starting spot to Hollister failing to make Buffalo's 53-man roster. The Bills will roll with Knox and\u00a0Tommy Sweeney as their top-two tight ends entering the regular season. Hollister, who had intermittent fantasy relevance in two years with the Seahawks, will land on a roster. It's also possible, as noted by The Athletic's\u00a0Joe Buscaglia, that the vested veteran is re-signed by the Bills following final cuts. This move would help the Bills avoid season ending IR for an injured player. Hollister\u00a0had four catches for 53 yards in three preseason games this month.\n",

    "analysis": "The Texans -- who inexplicably kept five running backs -- ended up with three tight ends after this week's roster cut-downs: Akins,\u00a0Pharaoh Brown, and fifth-round rookie Brevin Jordan. The Athletic's Aaron Reiss said Akins and Brown are the team's only pass-catching tight ends going into 2021. Akins, the team's starting tight end for much of 2020, could see significant playing time in Houston's offense this season. Akins last season had a respectable per-game average of 22.9 pass routes and 3.8 targets. The loss of red zone target TE Darren Fells could open up more high-value targets for Akins, who had 14 receptions for 162 yards and a touchdown in the 2020 season's first four weeks before missing time with a concussion.\u00a0The Texans being forced into pass-heavy game scripts could make Akins a decent option in deeper formats this season.\n",

In what was likely his last foray in professional football, Tebow, 33, tried to make the team as a tight end. He lasted one preseason game in which he didn't see a target. Signing his longtime buddy was always a questionable move by head coach Urban Meyer, whose first six months as an NFL coach have consisted of nonstop questionable decisions. Meyer said releasing Tebow was a \"tough thing\" but the \"right thing.\" CBS Sports' Pete Prisco, a former Jaguars beat writer, said Tuesday it \"was obvious [Tebow]\u00a0couldn\u2019t play tight end. Any other coach doesn\u2019t even give him a chance.\"\u00a0James O'Shaughnessy or Chris Manhertz will likely start the season as Jacksonville's TE1.\u00a0\n",

There was some buzz in the first week of August that Blankenship's job was in real danger a year after he logged the fifth most field goals in the NFL. The Colts attempted the fourth most field goals in 2020 -- a key factor in Blankenship's fantasy usefulness. There's no reason to reach for Hot Rod in 2021 drafts, though you could do worse than the second-year kicker in the final round of redraft leagues.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "This will be Prater's 37-year-old season. He's a career 83.2% kicker on field goals but is coming off a down 2020 with Detroit, making just 21-of-28 (75%) kicks. Prater has always kicked in favorable environments, going from Mile High to domed Ford Field and now the dome in Arizona. In the Cardinals' offense, Prater should remain very fantasy-relevant.\n",

Carlson converted 94.3 percent of his 2020 field goal attempts after he was a far worse 73.1 percent in 2019. Carlson was 4-of-4 beyond 50 yards last season as he quietly finished as fantasy's fourth highest scoring kicker thanks largely to the NFL's seventh most attempts. He'll likely be overdrafted in seasonal leagues this season. Coach Jon Gruden evidently believes the 26-year-old is his \"kicker of the future.\"\u00a0\n",

    "headlineNews": "Jaguars kicker Josh Lambo is competing for the team's starting job with Aldrick Rosas.\u00a0\n",
    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Jacksonville special teams coordinator Nick Sorensen confirmed the red-hot kicker competition during minicamp. Lambo's lingering hip injury limited him to four games in 2020 and left the team scrambling for viable kicker options. Jacksonville's cast of kickers hit 18 of their 25 field goal attempts (72 percent), the third lowest rate in the NFL. They were the third worst in extra point conversions too. The most accurate kicker in Jags history, Lambo will have to outplay Rosas this summer if he's to keep his gig in 2021. Rosas -- the seventh highest scoring kicker in 2018 as a member of the Giants -- made eight of 11 attempts last year for Jacksonville. Whoever wins the team's kicker job will have some streaming appeal this season.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Fantasy football's No. 2 kicker in 2020 is cashing in on a profoundly efficient season in which he made 36 of 39 field goal attempts, banging through all 36 of his extra point tries. He established himself as one of the league's big-footed kickers by nailing eight of nine kickers over 50 yards. Sanders' extension includes a $10 million guarantee. His 2020 numbers stand in stark contrast to his 2019 stats, which include seven missed field goals on 30 attempts. Only the Cowboys and Falcons attempted more field goals than Miami in 2020, giving Sanders the opportunity necessary to become a waiver wire darling in fantasy. Sanders will probably be one of the most over-drafted kickers in fantasy football next season.\u00a0\n",

McPherson is the favorite in the team's kicker competition with veteran Austin Seibert, who has also impressed coaches and beat writers this month. The Bengals offense is among the league's most kicker friendly. Last season, Randy Bullock was fantasy's third highest scoring kicker when Joe Burrow went down with a season-ending knee injury. Fantasy managers should consider McPherson if the game's top kickers are off the draft board.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "As Over The Cap pointed out on Twitter, 29-year-old Santos has been cut five times since 2018. To say it's an aggressive move would be putting it mildly. The Bears were simply overjoyed by Santos' competent 2020 after years in the kicker wilderness. Santos converted 93.8 percent of his 2020 field goal tries, boosting his career mark to 83.1. Santos is not called on very often from 50-plus yards, making him an extra unlikely recipient of this kind of contract. There's a chance this deal could quickly become an albatross.\u00a0\n",

When needed, Grant is plenty willing as a tackler and run fitter, though he is also still unrefined there. The Falcons lost starting safeties Ricardo Allen and Damontae Kazee this offseason, paving a path for Grant to potentially start in Week 1.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Sidelined since the first week of August with a knee issue, Barr is going to miss at least the season opener and possibly more. This will mark 15 straight missed games for the former standout linebacker. Barr missed almost the whole 2020 season with a torn pectoral muscle. Minnesota's defense should be much improved from the pushover unit of 2020, but Barr's absence could be felt against the potentially high-powered Bengals offense.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Acquired from the Texans in March, McKinney was running as a starter the first few weeks of camp before fading. His releases comes even after his contract was restructured in extremely team-friendly terms. Headed into his age-29 campaign,\u00a0McKinney was limited to four games by a shoulder injury last season. The Dolphins will move forward with\u00a0Jerome Baker and Elandon Roberts at inside 'backer. McKinney's experience\u00a0will probably make him a regular on the workout circuit this season.\u00a0\n",

It's a devastating blow for the Ravens after Peters bounced back from his mid-career malaise after arriving at the 2019 trade deadline. Peters' 31 interceptions lead the league since he entered in 2015. The Ravens still have a deeper corner group than most, but their formidable depth is being severely tested before the season even starts. No one on the roster, or really in the league, has Peters' ball-hawking instincts at the back end of Baltimore's defense. Four months shy of his 29th birthday, Peters' injury comes before he is due a non-guaranteed $10 million in 2022.\u00a0\n",
