    "analysis": "Early on, it looked like it could be more of the recent same for Winston, who tossed six interceptions in the two games prior to Sunday. Winston was guilty of his NFL-leading 19th and 20th  picks in the first half, but he continued to fight through his struggles and seemed to gain a measure of confidence when he successfully threaded the needle on a 71-yard touchdown throw to Chris Godwin midway through the opening quarter. Winston's most prolific target on the afternoon would remain Godwin, with whom he connected for a second score from a yard out in the second quarter. Winston's resurgent performance included his eighth 300-yard effort of the season, but the persistent pattern of turnovers is still a concern. Winston will look to put together a completely clean performance in a Week 13 interconference battle against the in-state Jaguars.",

He was also picked off prior to halftime, now giving him two interceptions on the season. Fortunately, he responded in the second half with a 23-yard touchdown to Travis Kelce, and his output on the ground actually marked his personal best to date. Although he's clearly over his recent knee injury and now has the bye week to rest further, Mahomes saw top wideout Tyreek Hill exit early Monday with a hamstring issue, so he may be down a dynamic weapon when he looks to bounce back in Week 13 versus the Raiders.",

    "analysis": "Jackson turned in a dazzling display, bolstering his MVP resume. The quarterback started by tossing touchdowns to Hollywood Brown on consecutive drives, then came inches away from a thrilling 36-yard scoring scamper on his next series. With another touchdown throw his next time out, however, Jackson not only led Baltimore to the end zone on all four of his first-half drives, but did so without a single incompletion. For an encore, he then opened the second half with back-to-back red-zone TD completions before making way for backup Robert Griffin to begin the fourth. Overall, it was a nearly perfect primetime performance from Jackson, who'll now look forward to a Week 13 showdown against the vaunted 49ers defense.",

    "analysis": "After neither team scored any points in the first quarter, Jones finally got the Giants on the board with a three-yard touchdown to Kaden Smith halfway through the second quarter -- the first score of the rookie tight end's career. Jones went quiet after that, but he found Golden Tate for a 23-yard touchdown to give his team hope with under five minutes remaining. The rookie quarterback also lost a fumble for a fifth consecutive game in the third quarter, setting Chicago up at New York's three-yard line. Jones suffered a cut on his throwing hand and was noticeably bleeding, though he was able to finish the game, so the injury is unlikely to affect him moving forward.",

The fourth-year quarterback's passing yardage total served as a season low for him in a non-injury-shortened game, and it was his second straight sub-200-yard effort overall while playing all four quarters. Hilton was on a snap limit of sorts Thursday -- which certainly didn't help Brissett overall -- but he also failed to connect with two of his other wideouts, Marcus Johnson and Zach Pascal. Brissett did manage his third rushing touchdown of the campaign with a five-yard score in the latter portion of the second quarter, but he'll look to significantly boost his passing production at the expense of the Titans in Week 13.",

Brees also matched a season-low in completion percentage (60) among games that he finished. The veteran signal-caller has played solid football since returning from a thumb injury in Week 8, and it was discouraging to see this kind of performance against a below-average Falcons defense. Things won't get any easier for the quarterback in Week 14 when the Saints face the 49ers in an important NFC showdown.",

The third-year signal-caller hit DeAndre Hopkins for beautifully thrown touchdown passes of 35 and 30 yards. He also connected with Will Fuller on throws of 44 and 51 yards, which helped him to come within two yards of his fourth 300-yard effort of the campaign on a relatively modest 19 completions. With the loss to Baltimore now exorcised, Watson will take on the daunting challenge of the Patriots defense in a Week 13 matchup, a week from this coming Sunday.",

Who he'll be throwing to this weekend isn't quite as clear, given that  Mohamed Sanu (ankle), Phillip Dorsett (concussion) and Julian Edelman (shoulder) are among the 17 players the team lists as questionable this week. With that in mind, we'd expect Edelman to be fine and it appears as though Dorsett should be available. Meanwhile, Sanu seems to be trending in the right direction, but we're not prepared to sign off on him returning to action this weekend just yet. Ideally, added clarity on the trio's status will arrive prior to the first wave of games Sunday, with the Patriots facing the Texans at 8:20 ET that evening.",

    "analysis": "For the second time in three games, Darnold kept the ball on an option play near the goal line for a rushing score, with this one coming from four yards out in the second quarter. His first pass of the second half went 69 yards to Braxton Berrios, and Darnold tossed a one-yard touchdown to Ryan Griffin on the next play before adding another one-yard touchdown to Robby Anderson to cap the following drive. With 608 yards and a 6:1 TD:INT through the air plus a rushing score in the past two weeks, Darnold has worked his way onto the Week 13 QB1 radar given his juicy matchup against the 0-11 Bengals.",

While Derrick Henry did plenty of the work, Tannehill also contributed a substantial amount. The highlight came on a touchdown pass to A.J. Brown, in which Tannehill hit the rookie wideout on a slant across the middle, which Brown then turned upfield for a 65-yard score. Tannehill also capped the scoring with a three-yard rushing touchdown -- his second of the game -- to put the Titans up 42-17.

The prettiest was a 54-yard bomb to Stefon Diggs early in the fourth quarter to bring Minnesota to within a score. Cousins sold a beautiful play-action fake, slid way out to his left and found Diggs flying up field. Cousins has been a completely different quarterback since Week 4's loss to Chicago, completing at least 70 percent of his passes in six of seven games and boasting a TD:INT of 18:1 all while Minnesota has gone on a 6-1 run. Next up, after the bye, is a visit to Seattle, where the Seahawks have struggled against the pass this season.",

    "analysis": "The injury to Jeff Driskel (hamstring) appears to have been a blessing in disguise for the Lions on Thanksgiving Day, as Detroit may have just found its long-term backup quarterback in Blough. Making his professional regular-season debut after going undrafted out of Purdue in 2018, Blough was ready for the moment and put the Lions on top early with a 75-yard touchdown to Kenny Golladay on the opening drive. He admittedly cooled off in the second and third quarters, but Blough nearly positioned Detroit for a game-winning touchdown had Danny Amendola been able to bring in a nearly perfect over-the-shoulder pass during the closing seconds of the game. Despite the loss, the Lions must be delighted with Blough's performance and it seems unlikely the team will go back to Driskel for next weekend's game in Minnesota, should Matthew Stafford (back) remain sidelined.",

Trubisky eclipsed the season-high 278 yards he'd just posted four days prior with his spectacular performance, making the last pair of contests his most productive two-game stretch of the season by far.

Allen generally struggled to move the offense in his three starts following Joe Flacco's (neck) placement on injured reserve, completing just 46.4 percent of his throws for 6.1 yards per attempt and a 3:2 TD:INT.",

    "analysis": "Lindsay was unable to shake loose against the Bills, but his 4.4 yards-per-carry average was all the more impressive considering the Denver pass offense did not pose a threat throughout the game. Lindsay is dangerous when he's able to get to the edge and slash through the line. That's becoming increasingly difficult as defenses have learned not to fear Brandon Allen's arm on dropbacks. A middle-of-the-road Chargers pass defense awaits Sunday, but Lindsay's value may ride on whether Allen is back under center or whether the Drew Lock era is upon us.",

    "report": "Fournette carried 24 times for 97 yards and two touchdowns Sunday against the Titans. He also caught nine of 12 targets for an additional 62 yards in the 42-20 loss.",
    "analysis": "Fournette managed just 4.0 yards per carry but nearly reached the 100-yard mark on the ground through sheer volume. He scored one-yard touchdowns on back-to-back drives in the second half and rounded out this excellent performance with a career high in receptions as his team played catchup for much of the afternoon. This was exactly what Fournette's fantasy owners wanted to see after he managed just 57 scrimmage yards on 15 touches last week and came in with just one touchdown to his name. He will face Tampa Bay's elite run defense next Sunday, but his involvement in the passing game and near the goal line should keep him firmly in fantasy lineups.",

Penny out-carried Carson 14-8 and registered 123 more rushing yards, although the former couldn't haul in his only target. Carson did fumble once -- he recovered -- but his backseat assignment was mainly attributed to how well Penny played, as Penny showed explosiveness, taking six carries for six or more yards while Carson did so just once. It remains to be seen to what degree Penny will cut into Carson's usage in the upcoming weeks, but coach Pete Carroll often went to the hot hand last season and may do the same going forward.

He also notched a new season high in receiving yardage thanks to a couple of big plays in the passing game. Kareem Hunt scored a short rushing touchdown in the first half, but Chubb got one of his own in the final minutes to end a four-game run without a TD. The second-year back continues to produce at a strong rate and will look to do so again next Sunday against the Steelers.",

Receiving production has salvaged fantasy utility for Freeman to some extent, but he's only eclipsed 40 rushing yards twice all year running behind a banged-up Falcons offensive line. Freeman is now afforded nine days to continue to bounce back from a sprained foot that previously sidelined him, before Atlanta takes on Carolina's 27th-ranked rush defense Dec. 8.",

In fact, he's the latest addition to a short list of running backs who are averaging at least 17 carries per game and 4.5 yards per carry, joining the likes of Christian McCaffrey, Nick Chubb, Derrick Henry, Josh Jacobs, Leonard Fournette and Dalvin Cook. That's pretty good company for someone who went completely overlooked by the league since being drafted in the seventh round of the 2018 NFL Draft, and Scarbourgh hasn't even played a game with a non-backup quarterback yet. It's possible Matthew Stafford (back) could return for the Lions' Week 14 date with the Vikings, and it'll be interesting to see if Scarbrough can take his game to another level with Stafford calling the shots instead of David Blough and Jeff Driskel.",

He was rather quiet in the passing game, however, which limited the extent to which he exploited this favorable matchup. Still, Hunt received double-digit touches yet again and should have a useful role again next Sunday against the Steelers.",

After totaling double-digit touches in each of the first three games of the season, he hasn't reached 10 in any of his last three contests. Sunday brings a matchup against a middle-of-the-road Chargers run defense, but Freeman may not get the touches necessary to take advantage.",

    "analysis": "The second-year back's 14 carries Monday were his highest total since Week 1, which was another Ravens rout. Coming off a game in which he posted impressive per-carry numbers against the Texans, Edward's usage against the Rams is sure to draw some attention, but context is important. Eleven of his totes came in the second half, with Baltimore having already built a three-score lead thanks in large part to the efforts of No. 1 RB Mark Ingram. Edwards certainly has the frame to be a bruising finisher, and the Ravens may be blowing a few more teams out down the stretch, but it will be somewhat of a shock if Sunday's opponent, the 49ers, are one of them. That said, don't be surprised if Baltimore goes particularly run heavy against a San Francisco defense that ranks tops in the league against the pass.",

Taking advantage of a career-high share of those plays, Penny compiled 14 carries for 129 yards and one touchdown, while Carson gained 57 yards from scrimmage on his 12 touches and fumbled for a seventh time this season. Considering Penny still averaged 5.5 yards per carry even after discounting his 58-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter he seems deserving of a role. It remains to be seen whether Carroll will uphold his end of the bargain.",

Cohen has yet to log double-digit carries in 2019, but he does now have at least four catches in four straight contests. The second-year back will look to keep that streak going versus the Cowboys in a Week 14 Thursday night matchup.",

    "analysis": "Brown led the team in targets, receptions and yards, his third explosive performance of the season. His standout catch came halfway through the third quarter, when he caught a Ryan Tannehill pass over the middle before turning upfield for a 65-yard touchdown. He also posted several other long receptions, including gains of 36, 19 and 15 yards. While Tannehill has moved the offense more effectively than Marcus Mariota, the Titans still focus on moving the ball predominantly on the ground rather than through the air. As a result, Brown is likely to remain only a volatile producer for the remainder of the season and will face the Colts in Week 13.",

The Vikings did well to get him into rhythm early and, though fans might have questioned why Diggs was being given such  generous cushions, he showed why midway through the fourth quarter when he burned the secondary on a double move for a 54-yard touchdown. Diggs has five touchdowns this season, but has scored them all in three games -- leaving himself scoreless in eight other contests. While that may be frustrating to fans, he has topped 100 yards in three of those eight contests and figures to continue to be fed the ball so long as Adam Thielen (hamstring) is out of the lineup. Next up, after the bye, is Seattle's 27th-ranked pass defense.",

Godwin eclipsed the 1,000-yard mark for the season with his stellar afternoon, one that featured a career high in receiving yardage and his first 100-yard game since Week 6. The stellar third-year pro will look to follow up his memorable performance in a Week 13 interconference matchup against the in-state Jaguars.",

After all, the majority of Golladay's production came on a 75-yard pass during the first drive of the game, and Golladay couldn't have been any more wide open than he was on that particular play. We'll simply need a larger sample size to understand if the Blough-to-Golladay connection is legit. To that end, next week's matchup with the declining Xavier Rhodes and the rest of the Vikings defense will present another good test, though it's possible Matthew Stafford (back) could return for that game, which would be good news for Golladay investors.",

    "analysis": "Though the Bears and Cowboys both played on Thanksgiving Day, the two teams will have a normal turnaround between games as they face one another on Thursday Night Football in Week 14. After being held without a catch in Week 12 in New England, Cooper bounced back nicely in a tough matchup versus the Bills on Thursday, hauling in eight of 11 targets for 85 yards in the 26-15 loss. Unfortunately, the oft-banged-up receiver came out of the contest with a left knee injury in tow. Though an MRI and X-ray cleared him of any structural damage, Cooper's practice reps may still be limited next week and at least temporarily cloud his status for the team's matchup with Chicago.",

Thielen also mentioned that he's unlikely to play in the game unless his hamstring is deemed 100 percent healthy, Ben Goessling of the Minneapolis Star Tribune reports.

Robinson was the runner-up in receptions, receiving yardage and targets to his second-year teammate, but the veteran still put together a highly productive follow-up to his season-best 131-yard effort in Week 12 against the Giants. Robinson will look to extend his scoring streak to three games when the Bears face off with the Cowboys in a Week 14 Thursday night battle.",

Though he doesn't hold quite the same value as he did earlier this season when veteran Case Keenum was lofting up passes to him in the end zone, the rookie is still Washington's most consistent pass-catcher and has rapport with fellow rookie Buckeye Dwayne Haskins. That was on display in the closing seconds of Sunday's win, when, facing third down, Haskins drove a 17-yard pass down the field to McLaurin, setting up the game-winning field goal. Sunday brings a tough matchup against a quality Panthers pass defense, but McLaurin is still a solid play despite Washington's offensive struggles due to his locked-in target volume and downfield prowess.",

Matthews has since been released, while Arcega-Whiteside and Ward should see their workloads scaled back considerably now that the team's top two wideouts are ostensibly healthy again.",

In fact, Thursday's touchdown marked Jones ninth score in 12 games this season and he only needs one more to match his career high of 10 touchdowns from the 2013 campaign with Cincinnati. Combined with his upside to rack up triple-digit receiving yards like he did in Week 3 and Week 9, Jones has been one of the most underrated fantasy assets in 2019 and up next is a Vikings team that Jones obliterated for 10 catches, 93 yards and four touchdowns back in Week 7.",

Thielen's status coming out of the bye week will be important to monitor, as the veteran target figures to eat into what production Johnson and tight end Kyle Rudolph have enjoyed in his absence.",

Miller's final catch of the day was the most critical, as he brought in a beautifully thrown ball from Mitchell Trubisky down the right sideline for a 32-yard grab on third-and-5, putting the ball at the Lions' three-yard line. With 33 targets over his last three contests, Miller is logging the type of volume that has exponentially raised his profile across all formats heading into a Week 14 Thursday night matchup versus the Cowboys.",

The veteran wideout has routinely had his practice reps capped due to the hamstring issue that has bothered him off and on since the preseason concluded, but he hasn't missed a game since Week 4. Look for him to have a regular role alongside Robby Anderson and Jamison Crowder in three-wideout formations against Cincinnati.",

    "analysis": "Parker shared the team lead in receptions with Albert Wilson while pacing the Dolphins in receiving yardage. The 2015 first-round pick is quietly putting together a solid season, as he's become a favorite downfield target of Ryan Fitzpatrick's and now has 695 receiving yards through 11 games, the second-highest tally of his career. Parker has at least five receptions in five of the last six games, giving him a solid fantasy floor in all formats heading into a Week 13 battle versus the Eagles.",

Engram and Ellison have been ruled out for another game, likely leaving Smith in an every-down role at tight end for a second time in as many weeks. With Golden Tate (concussion) also unavailable, it won't come as any surprise if Smith matches his target total from Week 12. That said, the Sunday weather forecast for East Rutherford doesn't look especially promising for passing and receiving production, as the game could be impacted by a mixture of snow, rain and wind.",

Ertz has garnered at least 11 targets in each of the Eagles' past three games, but he could take on a smaller role in the passing attack in Week 13 with the team slated to welcome its top two wideouts -- Alshon Jeffery (ankle) and Nelson Agholor (knee) -- to the lineup.",

Given how late it is into the season, there have to be serious doubts about coach Bruce Arians' willingness to incorporate Howard further into the offense, making him a highly speculative play against the Jaguars in Week 13.",

Gesicki came into the NFL a season ago with a reputation as an above-average pass-catching tight end, but the Dolphins' quarterback issues have played a large part in the Penn State product's underwhelming numbers overall. Gesicki does seem to be building some momentum with at least three catches in four straight contests and will look to keep that streak going versus the Eagles in Week 13.",

Despite the notable contributions of late, Graham has only garnered eight targets since Austin Hooper (knee-MCL) began his inactive stint Week 11. He's therefore a somewhat touchdown-dependent commodity heading into a Dec. 8 matchup against a Panthers defense that has only surrendered three scores to the tight end position all season.",
