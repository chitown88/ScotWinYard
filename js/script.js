The Packers opened with three straight touchdown drives, including a six-yard rushing score by Rodgers, but the Panthers' defense surprisingly locked up the Packers' offense after that, forcing a punt in six of the team's next seven drives. A major factor? The Panthers' pass rush, as Rodgers was sacked five times in this game, a rarity which prevented Rodgers from working his typical magic and find narrow passing lanes to rifle rockets into. Still, two touchdowns on a \"down\" fantasy day is difficult to complain about. Rodgers is an easy QB1 against the Titans in Week 16.\n",

Murray also joined\u00a0Cam Newton (2015) as the only players in league\u00a0history with\u00a0at least 25 passing touchdowns\u00a0and\u00a010 rushing scores\u00a0in a single season. The Cardinals stayed relevant as the No. 7 seed in the NFC with this win and\u00a0will attempt to tighten its grasp on a Wild Card berth in Week 16 against the 49ers.\n",

Considering the lack of weapons at his disposal, Watson has played as well as possible in three games since Will Fuller's steroid suspension began, though it has resulted in only three passing scores. He has added at least 6/25 as a rusher each time out, along with one ground score. Watson continues to operate near an MVP level, though it will be lost in the noise of the Texans' go-nowhere season. Get this man a competent coach and general manager. Despite his shaky surrounding circumstances, Watson will remain a top-10 option for Week 16 against the Bengals.\u00a0\n",

Mike Evans was also tackled at the one- and six-yard lines ahead of Leonard Fournette rushing scores, so Brady's day could have been even bigger. Brady's 390 yards marked a new season high, and he now gets a juicy Week 16 draw with the Lions, who Ryan Tannehill just blasted for five touchdowns in Week 15.\n",

That's the third lowest rate among quarterbacks who have played at least half their teams offensive snaps in 2020. Roethlisberger, especially in recent weeks, has been wildly inaccurate at times, raising questions about his comeback from offseason elbow surgery. He completed just 52.5 percent of his passes during Monday night's shocking loss to the Bengals. Roethlisberger has been less than serviceable for fantasy purposes of late, scoring less than 14 fantasy points in three of his past four outings. The aged veteran won't be more than a mid-range QB2 in Week 16 against the Colts.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "With the Dolphins' skill corps severely short-handed and Salvon Ahmed returning, Tagovailoa was a strict game manager, completing zero passes longer than 15 yards. His interception was a poor red zone decision in the first quarter where he forced the ball to Lynn Bowden in the end zone as he was getting hit. Tagovailoa compensated by avoiding further cough ups and contributing three- and one-yard rushing scores, displaying a nice little shoulder fake on the three-yarder. He's up to three rushing touchdowns over his past two games. With DeVante Parker and Mike Gesicki hopefully returning for Week 16 against the Raiders,\u00a0Tagovailoa should have a little more QB2 juice for a plus matchup.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

Tannehill then kept it with a 17-yard touchdown run in the second frame before accounting for three touchdowns in the final quarter. Tannehill rushed for a three-yard score, hit A.J. Brown for a two-yarder, and then tossed a three-yarder to backup RB Darrynton Evans. Tannehill is just adding to his new career high with 31 touchdown passes now and will likely get some MVP votes. The Titans wrap up the season with road games at Green Bay and Houston. Tannehill is an every-week QB1 ahead of the Week 16 date with the Packers.\n",

The Chargers recovered it in the end zone, but due to the \"Holy Roller\" rule (Google it), it was not a score. Herbert's late heroics came after an incomprehensible fourth quarter where he attempted \u2014 this is not a joke \u2014 one pass as Michael Badgley missed his eighth and ninth field goal attempts of the year. Before that, Herbert relentlessly worked connections with Hunter Henry and Jalen Guyton as Keenan Allen could barely move thanks to his hamstring injury. It was a needed showing out basically without his best receiver on the heels of his recent slump. Cruising toward ending 2020 with the rookie touchdown record \u2014 he has already tied Baker Mayfield at 27 \u2014 Herbert catches the Broncos in Week 16.\u00a0\n",

Tonight, Bridgewater fumbled on the goal line while attempting to reach the ball over the plane. He also fumbled again later on inside the five-yard line, but the play ultimately did not count. Bridgewater simply is not skilled enough to mask earlier mistakes, and is now 0-for-8 on the season in game-winning drive scenarios.

    "analysis": "It was easily one of Ryan's best games of the season, and he was able to pull it off with Julio Jones (hamstring) out of the lineup. The Falcons took a 17-0 lead into halftime after Ryan hit Russell Gage and Calvin Ridley for five- and 12-yard touchdowns before the break. But the Bucs dominated the second 30 minutes. Ryan's third touchdown was a seven-yard hookup with Hayden Hurst. He had Calvin Ridley for an open second score, but CB Antoine Winfield Jr. made a great play on the ball in the end zone to break it up at the last second. Ryan's 356 yards were his third-most of the season, and it was his first 300-yard game since Week 7. It's impossible to trust Ryan outside of two-QB fantasy leagues, but he should be throwing a ton again next week in a road date at Kansas City. The Falcons have no running game whatsoever.\n",

    "analysis": "Newton has thrown three touchdowns over his past six outings. It's bleak for the Patriots passing game -- and the offense in general -- as Joe Flacco has more touchdown tosses than Newton this season in just five games. What started out on a hopeful note for Newton and the Patriots has dissolved into a disaster;\u00a0the team will miss the playoffs for the first time since 2008 after Week 15's loss to Miami. The veteran isn't playable outside of superflex formats in Week 16 against the Bills.\u00a0\n",

Goff looked like he was playing the 2000 Ravens or 1985 Bears in the first half, overseeing one three-and-out after another while turfing passes and nearly committing catastrophic giveaways. He did \"convert\" one, throwing an interception to a dropping Bryce Hall against a zone defense. Goff almost committed the exact same mistake in the second half, but the throw was a little too high for the corner. Goff was better after the break, but it was too little, too late for a dazed Rams squad, one that relinquished control of the NFC West to the 10-4 Seahawks. The 'Hawks now\u00a0\"control\u00a0their destiny\" for the division title. The 9-5 Rams would have at least clinched a postseason appearance with a victory. This makes Week 16 vs. Seattle a de facto division championship game after the Rams beat Russell Wilson's squad in Week 10. With the Seahawks' defense continuing to play better, Goff will not be all that appetizing of a streamer for the fantasy finals.\u00a0\n",

With Antonio Gibson (toe) additionally doubtful to suit up, OC Scott Turner would be wise to scheme the ball out of Haskins' hand as quickly as possible. Terry McLaurin, who did record a team-high in target share from Haskins last year, is hanging by a thread in the second round of the fantasy playoffs.\n",

The also 1-13 Jaguars hold the tiebreaker with the easier strength of schedule. Jets fans will be aghast that Gang Green did not see the tank through, but truth be told, they did not play that well or aggressively. The Rams simply slept walked through a catastrophic loss. The Jets put the ball in Frank Gore's gut over and over again, and his 23/59/1 line was somehow enough. Darnold's score was an 18-yard strike to Ty Johnson on the Jets' opening drive where the Rams never accounted for the running back. There was a miscommunication between the linebackers and secondary. Beyond that, Darnold found each of Jamison Crowder, Chris Herndon and Breshad Perriman for 20-yard gains, but nothing longer than 24. It was mostly the same old Jets, minus no turnovers. It was not the same old Rams. The Jets close the season vs. CLE and @NE, with the Jags going vs. CHI, @IND. That is a distinct Jags advantage when it comes to landing, yes, generational talent Lawrence.\u00a0\n",

Henry looked to be well on his way to another huge afternoon after capping an easy opening drive with a three-yard touchdown, but Henry never found the end zone again, as he watched Ryan Tannehill rush for 17- and three-yard scores before backup RB Darrynton Evans caught a three-yarder in the fourth quarter. Henry's ceiling is so high that 24-147-1 almost feels like a letdown. But he gets another juicy draw in Week 16 at the Packers. Henry needs 321 yards over the final two weeks for a 2,000-yard rushing campaign.\n",

The box score wasn't kind to Carson (who admittedly didn't stand out on tape), but he still handled 15-of-19 carries and 17-of-23 touches among Seattle's backfield even with Rashaad Penny back in the mix for the latter's first game of the year. The Seahawks' offensive game plan was abundantly clear as the team rushed 26 times to Russell Wilson's 27 pass attempts. Carlos Hyde opened the second half with a 50-yard touchdown run, but Carson is still clearly the running back to roster for the Fantasy Championship among this group. Carson also had at least three targets for the third consecutive game. Consider him a volume-based RB2 in a tough matchup against the Rams in Week 16.\n",

He walked in for a first half touchdown on one of the many Baltimore scoring drives against a lackluster Jacksonville defense. Gus Edwards had nine\u00a0rushes against the Jags. Dobbins looks unlikely to see a 20-plus carry workload in the season's waning weeks, making him more of a floor play than a high ceiling option. Dobbins will be a safe RB2 option in Week 16 against the Giants.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Jacobs entered the proceedings with an ankle issue and exited it with a knee aggravation. In between, he was running into one brick wall after another on early downs as Marcus Mariota piled up one big play after another with his legs. Jacobs got stood up on\u00a0five\u00a0different carries inside the Chargers' five-yard line, though he thankfully turned a sixth into a one-yard score in the third quarter when he went over the top of the pile. Otherwise, it was an inefficient, unwatchable mess of a performance. The awful stat line is all the more remarkable because Jacobs actually uncorked a 20-yard run, just his second of the season. Jacobs thankfully has nine days to heal up for Week 16 against the Dolphins, but he will be a low-ceiling RB2 whose entire fantasy case rests on volume.\u00a0\n",

Sanders has also logged 81% of Philadelphia's offensive snaps in both of his last two games.

It gives Gase plausible deniability that he wasn't trying to give up on Gang Green's Trevor Lawrence tank. The Rams were just even worse today. Gore will be a low-floor, nonexistent-ceiling RB4 for Week 16 against the Browns' tough run defense.\u00a0\n",

Barber unsurprisingly came in on the goal line, punching in a one-yard run to bring Washington within two scores ahead of the final quarter, but it was still McKissic who was leaned on in the second half.

The 26 touches were easily a new season high, as Cincinnati went with a Bernard-centric game plan featuring their running game. He and Ryan Finley combined for 35 carries, as Finley threw the ball just 13 times in a game the Bengals surprisingly controlled from start to finish. Bernard's scores were a four-yard rushing score on the ground and 14-yard receiving one from Finley where the QB was drilled on the throw. Bernard can't be trusted as anything more than a low-end RB2 for Week 16 at Houston.\n",

Not that he needed to tell us that; Gurley, who the Falcons signed to a one-year, $5.5 million contract after he was cut from the Rams, has fallen forward for 60 yards on 23 carries in his last four games. Smith has run for 37/167/1 and 4.5 yards per carry in that stretch but has still offered minimal value for fantasy since both Brian Hill and Gurley have stayed involved in lesser roles. If this is Morris' way of changing the guard and seeing what Smith has to offer as a featured back in Atlanta's last two games, Ito suddenly stands out as an interesting FLEX and DFS option in an uptempo matchup against the Chiefs in Week 16. He'll likely make an appearance\u00a0in John Daigle's Waiver Wire column on Tuesday.\n",

Swift got the start in this one, and his 19 touches easily paced the Lions' backfield ahead of Adrian Peterson's six and Kerryon Johnson's goose egg. Swift lost an early fumble at the goal line as he attempted to jump over the pile into the end zone from the one-yard line, but the Lions stuck with him, and he made up for the turnover with two- and six-yard touchdown runs. Swift now has 30 touches over the last two weeks since returning from his concussion. Swift gets a tough Week 16 date with the Bucs but will be an upside RB2 for that one.\n",

    "headlineNews": "Leonard Fournette rushed 14 times for 49 yards and two touchdowns in the Bucs' Week 15 win over the Falcons.\n",
    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Fournette made the start with Ronald Jones (finger, COVID) out, and his 14 carries easily paced the backfield, as Ke'Shawn Vaughn handled the other two reps. Fournette wasn't very good in this one, but he did convert a pair of one-yard touchdowns after Mike Evans was stopped inside the five a couple times. Fournette also caught 3-of-5 targets for 16 yards in the passing game. It's unclear how long Jones will be out, but Fournette did enough in this one to feel comfortable with him as a legit back-end RB1 against the Lions in Week 16 if Jones sits again.\n",

Myles Gaskin's (COVID-19) likely Week 16 return will throw Miami's running back group back into flux for the fantasy finals, but at least as of today, Ahmed will be the best roto play.

    "headlineNews": "Falcons interim coach Raheem Morris said Ito Smith is \"the lead runner\u00a0right now.\"\n",
    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Morris also said Todd Gurley's role has \"changed\" of late. Not that he needed to tell us that; Gurley, who the Falcons signed to a one-year, $5.5 million contract after he was cut from the Rams, has fallen forward for 60 yards on 23 carries in his last four games. Smith has run for 37/167/1 and 4.5 yards per carry in that stretch but has still offered minimal value for fantasy since both Brian Hill and Gurley have stayed involved in lesser roles. If this is Morris' way of changing the guard and seeing what Smith has to offer as a featured back in Atlanta's last two games, Ito suddenly stands out as an interesting FLEX and DFS option in an uptempo matchup against the Chiefs in Week 16. He'll likely make an appearance\u00a0in John Daigle's Waiver Wire column on Tuesday.\n",

    "analysis": "This is a stunningly low yardage total on\u00a010 targets for a player of Adams' caliber, but two drops and the Packers leading 21-3 at halftime certainly played a factor. For comparison, Adams produced 115 yards on 10 targets in Week 14. The Panthers' leaky secondary did a fantastic job against the Packers' passing game and quickly made tackles to prevent yards after catch opportunities. Plus, Aaron Rodgers completed just two passes that traveled more than 10 yards in the air on Saturday night. The timing is not great, but continue to trust Adams as a WR1 for the final two weeks of the season.\n",

He's only played in nine games this year and the Falcons are already out of playoff contention. However, Jones got a PRP injection in his calf which should expedite the healing process. He clearly wants to get back on the field but it doesn't make much sense for Atlanta to let Jones return with nothing to play for. The Falcons face the Chiefs and the Bucs in their final two games so Jones would likely be a borderline WR1 if he does play either week.\u00a0\n",

Brutal, but as long as Allen avoided setbacks, he now has 10 days to get closer to 100 percent health for Week 16 against the Broncos' injured secondary.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "The seven targets tied Antonio Brown and Rob Gronkowski for the team lead. Evans posted a goose egg in the first quarter, and the Bucs were shut out in the first half. But Evans was the main source of yards for the offense in this one and was tackled at the one-yard line on a long catch to set up a Leonard Fournette touchdown. Evans was again later tackled inside the 10 to set up a second Fournette rushing score. It was Evans' first 100-yard game since Week 4. Evans has 11 scores on the year but hasn't found the end zone in back-to-back games ahead of a Week 16 date with the Lions where Evans will be an upside WR1/2.\n",

Moore simply was relied on more to create downfield, and Joe Brady attempted to incorporate Curtis Samuel near the line of scrimmage. Still, the 21 yards were enough to get Anderson over 1,000 receiving yards on the season for the first time in his career. Anderson and Moore are the last Panthers' duo to both reach the 1,000-yard mark in the same season since Muhsin Muhammad and Patrick Jeffers in 1999.\n",

McLaurin has been involved frequently from Alex Smith and Haskins, but it hasn't amounted to more than 100 yards or a touchdown in any of his last six games.

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Lockett finished with a team-high in targets (7-6), which can likely be attributed to D.K. Metcalf's absence for a brief period\u00a0with a hamstring injury in the first half.\u00a0More importantly, Lockett quietly reached 85 catches on the year, which qualifies as a new career-high mark. Seattle ran the ball 26 times (compared to 27 pass attempts), which sunk Lockett's and Metcalf's ceilings from kick-off, but the former is still the team's clear-cut No. 2 wideout. Even so, Lockett has now totaled less than 70 receiving yards in seven consecutive games and continues to plummet down rankings as a low-end WR2 ahead of\u00a0Week 16 against the Rams.\n",

Leonard punched the ball into the end zone and the Colts recovered with 0:19 remaining. That was that. Coutee has provided some PPR WR3 goodness since Will Fuller's steroid ban kicked in three games ago, but his Week 13 ceiling effort is predictably looking illusory. That being said, Coutee catches a gorgeous fantasy finals matchup in the Bengals. He will find himself in the WR30-36 range.\u00a0\n",

He was wide open on several of his first half receptions against a Jaguars secondary that didn't seem all that interested in covering Baltimore pass catchers. One of fantasy's biggest disappointments in 2020, Andrews will look to continue his solid finish to the season in Week 16 against the Giants. He'll be a TE1.\u00a0\n",

That, of course, doesn't matter for those who rode him as a TE1/2 in fantasy semis. The Giants offense is hard to bet on unless Daniel Jones is healthy and the matchup is clean. It's unclear if Jones will be ready for next week, and the Giants will be playing in Baltimore. Engram will be\u00a0more of a high-end TE2 than a mid-range TE1.\n",

Thomas was arguably open for even more opportunity than his\u00a0box score shows. He'll (continue to) be a unanimous TE1 in Week 16 against Carolina.\n",
