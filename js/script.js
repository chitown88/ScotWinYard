    "analysis": "It was the sleepiest of efforts on a day where the Lions ran over the Jaguars on the ground (39/180/3). Stafford's score was a one-yarder where T.J. Hockenson fell backward into the end zone. His interception was tossed in the direction of two leaping linemen. Stafford otherwise played game manager as the Lions easily won on the road. The owner of just nine touchdowns through five starts, Stafford has looked nothing like the aggressive madman he was in the first half of 2019. He's yet to have a 300-yard day and is completing a modest 60.7 percent of his passes. Fantasy managers will hopefully get more in next week's almost-guaranteed shootout with the Falcons.\u00a0\n",

Herbert was electric in the first half, going 9-of-13 for 109 yards and three touchdowns, but he lost Keenan Allen to a second-quarter back injury and was left with just Mike Williams and Hunter Henry. Williams caught four- and 64-yard scores, and Henry secured a red-zone touchdown of his own after Allen caught Herbert's first score from 17 yards away. The Allen touchdown throw was an incredible on-the-move bullet where Herbert escaped the rush. Henry's touchdown was a perfectly-placed out route. Herbert has been great since stepping in as the starter and has particularly excelled under pressure. Herbert will be a QB2 after the bye when the Bolts face the Jaguars.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Ryan was in an 11-quarter\u00a0touchdown drought when he found Julio Jones for a first-quarter touchdown. Jones was the missing ingredient for the entire Falcons offense in recent weeks. He adds way more big-play potential and allows more room for ancillary pieces to operate. Ryan's best play was a scramble on 4th-and-1 that resulted in a flick to Jones for a 40-yard run-and catch. When Ryan, Jones, and Calvin Ridley are fully healthy, Ryan can be jammed inside top-12 fantasy rankings. That should be the case at home next week with Detroit traveling south.\u00a0\n",

But the Saints found a bit of a groove after halftime and were able to erase a 17-point deficit. Brees' touchdown was a 41-yard hookup to Jared Cook, and he also rushed for a one-yard touchdown on a QB dive at the goal line. Brees has lost a lot as a thrower in recent years and has settled in as more of a QB2 for fantasy ahead of a Week 7 date with the Panthers following the bye.\n",

Allen simply struggled to make tight-window throws and looked like his 2019 self. For fantasy managers, his two scores and 42\u00a0rushing yards on eight carries saved an otherwise quiet day. He remains a QB1 because of his rushing prowess and high touchdown rate. He should have no problem rebounding versus the lowly Jets defense next week.\n",

He also lost a fumble in his own red zone moments after LT Taylor Lewan departed with a knee issue. Fill-in Ty Sambrailo got beaten like a drum by J.J. Watt, and Tannehill got crunched\u00a0on third down. Other than that, it felt like one big gain after another, including a pair of scores to A.J. Brown. Tannehill found backup TE Anthony Firkser for 8/113/1 after Jonnu Smith was forced out with an ankle injury. The Titans like to limit Tannehill's attempts, but he was more than capable of keeping up in shootout ball. After facing Romeo Crennel's swinging gate defense, Tannehill does have a much tougher Week 7 assignment in the Steelers.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

Brady only had to manage this one until the end, rekindling an old flame with Rob Gronkowski (5/78/1) as Ronald Jones (23/113/2) bulldozed his way to his third consecutive 100-yard performance on the ground. Expect Brady to attempt more than 27 passes against Las Vegas' potent offense in Week 7.\n",

    "analysis": "Kyle Allen will get the start for a second straight week after missing some time in Week 5 with a shoulder injury. Alex Smith will back him up with Haskins inactive. Allen completed 9-of-13 attempts for 74 yards before leaving his game against the Rams. He struggled with interceptions and sacks in 12 starts with the Panthers last year. The only bright side is that he did propel D.J. Moore and Christian McCaffrey to career years. Terry McLaurin and Antonio Gibson are both worth starting in fantasy despite the questionable quarterback play.\n",

Josh Jacobs scored a pair of touchdowns on the ground in the fourth frame to seal the win. Carr now has back-to-back 300-yard games and multiple touchdowns in four straight outings. Ruggs' return to the lineup really opens up the offense. The Raiders now have their bye week before a Week 7 date with the Bucs. Carr is still just a middling QB2 in fantasy.\n",

The bad throws were too many to even count, and Dalton couldn't move the ball despite his elite wideout trio, instead checking down to Ezekiel Elliott for a team-high 11 targets. The Dallas offensive line has been wrecked by injuries, but Dalton did nothing to help them out. A late-game goal-line sequence was littered with laughably off-target throws before he finally hit Amari Cooper for a short, meaningless touchdown to bring the score to 38-10. Dalton will have better days, but it's clear he's not going to be anything like Prescott. Things should be a little easier next week at Washington, but the Football Team defense is probably a better one-for-one fantasy play.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "The New Orleans offense was shut down by the L.A. defense for much of the first half, but they finally found a groove, and Kamara made a huge, juggling 28-yard catch down the right sideline to set up a late Taysom Hill rushing touchdown. This was Kamara's fourth straight 100-yard game and his first touchdown-less outing of the season. He's been incredible in the absence of Michael Thomas (ankle), but Thomas should be back for Week 7 after the Saints' bye. Kamara gets a date with the Panthers in two weeks.\n",

He finally had one of the eruption games he is good for 3-4 times per season, kicking his day into hyperdrive with a\u00a094-yard\u00a0scoring rumble early in the fourth quarter. Henry made a subtle cut at the line of scrimmage, cut back at the second level of the defense and then left the entire Texans defense \u2014 most notably LB Tyrell Adams \u2014 in the dust. Score No. 2 was a walkoff five-yarder in overtime that Henry took on a direct snap. Moments earlier, he added a 52-yard reception on a screen. Henry's only blemish was a number of screens where he could not quite hook up with Ryan Tannehill for what likely would have been big gains. Now with two touchdowns in each of his past three contests, Henry will remain a top-three play for next Sunday's showdown with the Steelers' elite run defense.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Mixon actually exited for a short period\u00a0in the first half but was able to return after the intermission. His lone touchdown was set up by Tee Higgins' (6/125) 67-yard catch along the sideline in the second quarter. With 47 carries in his last three starts, Mixon's role (assuming he's healthy in Week 7) remains that of a workhorse RB1. Fantasy players should continue starting him with confidence in Cincinnati's next game against Cleveland.\n",

Darrel Williams logged the only rushing touchdown for Kansas City.\u00a0Edwards-Helaire broke tackles at will and set career marks for carries and yards. Le'Veon Bell is set to join the team this week but\u00a0Edwards-Helaire's performance made have earned him a larger split over Bell.

Jones' two touchdowns were also runs from inside the five-yard line as coach Bruce Arians continues leaning on the former as the team's bell-cow in this stretch. Look for Jones to continue his surge as an RB2 in Week 7 against Las Vegas.\n",

The NFL can still step in and impose a minor suspension\u00a0at some point. Because Denver was pleased with how Gordon handled himself following the DUI, this also means that a ceremonious ban on the opening drive is likely off the table as well. Gordon did not travel with the team this week because of a non-COVID illness. Expect him to return to his usual RB2 status in Week 7 versus the Chiefs unless the NFL disciplines him in the coming week.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "That Week 8 game is a Thursday Night Football tilt, so it appears instead of trying to hurry CMC back for what would be two games in five days, the Panthers are trying to build him back to full strength for a divisional showdown. Although it sometimes feels like Mike Davis has barely missed a beat in McCaffrey's absence, he has been less efficient both as a runner and receiver. Getting CMC back will be a humongous boost for the surprisingly-competitive Panthers, as well as a game changer for the fantasy season stretch run. If you're rostering Davis, treat Sunday vs. the Saints as the last dance.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Singletary was the primary ball-carries in Zack Moss's first game back from a toe injury. The rookie still took five rushes from him but was similarly ineffective. Buffalo's offensive line routinely let defenders get in the backfield so many of Singletary's carries were blown up shortly after the snap. Singletary caught one of his two targets for 13 yards. The Bills should have no problem rolling the Jets in Week 7. A healthy lead should boost the rushing output from Singletary next week but he remains an RB2/3 with Moss stealing work from him.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Every mark was a new career high on the ground. Swift's 14 carries more than doubled his previous season total. His first touchdown was a one-yarder early in the second quarter he was allowed to punch in after failing on two previous goal-line carries. His second was a six-yarder early in the fourth. The big play was a 54-yard rumble in the first quarter where Swift was essentially untouched through a huge hole on the right side of Detroit's line. This is what Swift's fantasy managers have been waiting for all season, though Adrian Peterson remained involved for a team-leading 15 carries, one of which he converted\u00a0for a score. Either way, with Swift finally demonstrating some upside on all three downs, he is now a safe FLEX option. He will be a top-30, and arguably top-24, back for Week 7 vs. a Falcons defense that coughs up one running back reception after another.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Hasty, who started the season on the Niners' practice squad, emerged as the primary ball carrier after Raheem Mostert left with an ankle injury. Jerick McKinnon got six carries against the Rams, but it was Hasty who was in the game when the Niners sealed the victory. Head coach Kyle Shanahan said \"Hasty was up for the challenge. Got some fresh legs in there and I thought he gave us some juice a little bit.\" Jeff Wilson was inactive Sunday night with a calf injury and Tevin Coleman remains sidelined with a knee issue. Hasty,\u00a0who recorded the best shuttle-time (4.03 seconds) of any back at this year's Combine, could be next in the revolving door of San Francisco running backs. He should be picked up this week in 12-team leagues.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "It's safe to say Jones was truly healthy for this one. He was as explosive as always, showing off big-play potential on his two touchdowns. His first was a 20-yard strike and his second was a 40-yard run-and-catch on a broken 4th-down play. Jones' reinjury risk is the only thing separating him from the other elite fantasy receivers. With Atlanta expected to play little defense and find themselves in shootouts, Jones has a top-three ceiling for the rest of the season. Hopefully his hamstring injury is behind him. The Detroit Lions are Jones' next victim.\n",

His scores went for six and seven yards, with No. 2 coming with four seconds remaining in regulation. He beat Bradley Roby 1-on-1 in the back left corner of the end zone. The seven looks were still a somewhat disappointing total with Corey Davis on the COVID-19 list and Jonnu Smith departing early with an ankle issue, but the Titans are trying to be proactive in getting Brown the ball. The WR2 has a tough Week 7 assignment in the Steelers.\u00a0\n",

Ridley and Jones can provide WR1 value for the rest of the season as long as the Falcons' defense remains a bottom-10 unit. Matt Ryan looked sharp in this one and that trend should continue with the Lions on schedule next.\n",

And that includes his meaningless one-yard touchdown catch with 2:48 left to play in the fourth quarter. Still, fantasy managers don't care how the numbers happen, so it was a nice rebound box score for Cooper after his 2-23 line in Week 5. Cooper will be a back-end WR2 for Week 7 at Washington.\n",

Johnson has yet to play a full game since Chase Claypool was thrust into the lineup, but the two are expected to remain afloat ahead of JuJu Smith-Schuster even when all three are (finally) on the field together. This situation could become a mess for\u00a0fantasy if James Washington also keeps involved.\n",

He now has 16 catches for 227 yards and two scores over the past two weeks. Those who picked up Fulgham on the waiver wire this week might have a plug-and-play option for the rest of the season. He tied Zach Ertz for the most targets among Eagles pass catchers against Baltimore. Fulgham should be in lineups next week against a vulnerable Giants secondary.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Playing through ribs and hip injuries, Landry's three catches matched a season low and his 40 yards were the second-fewest single-game output this year. Baker Mayfield was dreadful before getting benched in the third quarter. But Landry really hasn't been great this year, as he doesn't look close to 100% over his offseason hip surgery. Landry is a WR4 for Week 7 against the Bengals.\n",

It should have been more, as D.J. created plenty of separation on a vital 4th and 2 conversion, but Teddy Bridgewater simply missed him. While that was not his fault, Moore also claimed a couple of drops throughout the game. While Robby Anderson remains a significant piece of the offense, Moore is starting to secure his spot as a WR2 moving forward. The Panthers take on the Saints in Week 7.\n",

New England wideouts are going to see down days in what will be a low-volume passing attack. Byrd should be rostered in 14-team leagues.\u00a0\n",

The tight end has recorded 28 targets over the last four games, which also coincides with Nick Foles' entry into the lineup. Graham is a fringe top 15 tight end based on that volume alone.\n",
