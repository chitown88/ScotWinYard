The sophomore gunslinger hasn't become the polished pocket passer we thought we were witnessing following a five-touchdown performance back in Week 1, but he doesn't need to be if he continues to post fantasy totals akin to running backs on a weekly basis (79.6 rushing yards per game and five total rushing touchdowns). Jackson gets a tasty matchup against the Bengals (who rank in the bottom third against both the run and the pass) on Sunday.",

Additionally, Matt Moore's solid play in relief of Mahomes makes such an approach even more feasible. We should get a better idea of Mahomes' odds of returning this weekend once it's revealed who takes first-team QB reps at practice Wednesday.",

    "report": "Winston completed 29 of 44 passes for 335 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions in the Buccaneers' 40-34 overtime loss to the Seahawks on Sunday. He also rushed twice for eight yards and lost a fumble.",
    "analysis": "Winston managed to stay away from interceptions after throwing seven picks over the prior two games, but he lost the handle on a Mychal Kendricks sack early in the fourth quarter just inside Seattle territory. It was the embattled quarterback's eighth fumble of the season overall -- although he's only lost three of them -- and his 15th turnover of the campaign. Winston was otherwise excellent from a fantasy perspective, wracking up his third straight 300-yard performance and fifth overall in the last six games. He continued to demonstrate an elite level of chemistry with Mike Evans in particular, connecting with his No. 1 wideout on 12 occasions for 180 yards and one of his scores. Winston is providing fantasy managers with week-winning numbers, even as his team sinks further in the standings. He'll look to help generate a win alongside strong production against the Cardinals in Week 10.",

Brees showed his connection with Michael Thomas was as healthy as ever by connecting with his star wideout on 11 occasions, and he managed to hook up with nine different pass catchers on the afternoon overall. According to John Hendrix of WDSU-TV, Brees wore a hard plastic splint on the thumb Sunday and doesn't expect any residual soreness Monday, given how careful he was in his rehab. Brees will look to return even healthier Week 10 against the Falcons following the Saints' bye week.",

That may have helped lead to Cousins generating his second-lowest completion percentage of the season, but he still found a way to his fourth multi-touchdown effort in the last five games by notching scoring tosses to Bisi Johnson, Ameer Abdullah and Kyle Rudolph. Cousins now has three straight interception-free efforts, and he'll look to continue building momentum at the expense of the Cowboys in Week 10.",

He started with a 30-yard touchdown pass to George Kittle in the closing seconds of the first quarter and followed up with scoring tosses of seven, one and 21 yards to Kendrick Bourne, Emmanuel Sanders and Dante Pettis, respectively. Although he had a relatively quiet fourth quarter in comparison, Garoppolo was able to lead a key 11-play drive to kill the remaining 4:35 of clock after the Cardinals had closed to 28-25, firing an 11-yard pass to Ross Dwelley at the two-minute warning on 3rd-and-9 to seal the victory. The performance was Garoppolo's first completely turnover-free effort of the season, and he'll look to follow it up in another NFC West showdown against the Seahawks in Week 10.",

Jones also ended the game with a fumble that was returned 63 yards for a touchdown, giving him a league-high eight lost fumbles. On the bright side, Jones actually led his team in rushing, posting a career-best total on the ground. He should find the going easier in Week 10 versus the Jets.",

He capped the opening drive with a 12-yard touchdown pass to Jamison Crowder and appeared to throw a two-yard touchdown to tight end Ryan Griffin late in the first half, but the play was controversially taken off the board on replay, and Darnold was picked off on the ensuing play. Darnold has been part of the problem in New York's 1-7 start, and his carelessness in the red zone has been particularly worrisome. However, you can't pin all of this team's struggles on the second-year quarterback, considering the offensive line is constantly allowing free rushers into the backfield. The bottom line from a fantasy perspective is that Darnold has a dreadful 3:8 touchdown to interception ratio over his last three games.",

    "analysis": "After a three-turnover outing in a loss to San Francisco in Week 8, Allen bounced back in Sunday's win over the Titans, completing 17 of 32 attempts for 232 yards, two touchdowns and an interception in the victory. With Cam Newton (foot) progressing slowly in his rehab and speculation mounting that he'll eventually move to injured reserve, Allen looks poised to continue starting for the Panthers beyond Week 10.",

Considering Ryan was able to practice in a limited fashion Friday, the Falcons never seemed fearful he would be in store for a lengthy absence. Quinn confirmed as much Monday, stating that the 34-year-old probably would be able to play if the Falcons had a game Week 9. The bye week nonetheless comes at a convenient time for Ryan, who has a real chance at entering the Nov. 10 game against the Saints minus an injury designation entirely.",

However, after completing 67 percent of his passes with a 24:12 TD:INT in 2018, he's fallen to 63 percent and 5:3 in seven games this season, and his performance has been one of the main problems with the Bears' offensive performance. That said, with a 3-5 record and a playoff berth extremely unlikely, it may not make sense to make a move to Chase Daniel unless the organization was convinced they need to go in a different direction next year at quarterback. Trubisky's status likely will be a weekly topic of discussion for the rest of the season.",

Carson was the first player to rush for over 100 yards against the Bucs this season, and he did it by averaging 6.6 YPC. His day was highlighted when he ripped off a 59-yard run, but he fumbled the ball and luckily it went out of bounds. Carson lost a fumble later in the contest as well, but the Seahawks never lost faith in the lead back by deploying Rashaad Penny for just four carries. Carson's fumbles are definitely concerning going forward, but his positive contributions in this win, fortunately, outweigh the whiffs. He'll look to keep it up in Week 10 against the 49ers.",

If Conner incurs no setbacks with his sprained right shoulder during practice, he could be ready to step back into his normal lead role out of the backfield right away after a one-game absence. Jaylen Samuels and Trey Edmunds (ribs) split the backfield reps in the Week 9 win over the Colts, with the former making his biggest impact in the passing game and the latter leading the Steelers' ground attack.",

Since returning Week 7 against Miami, the rookie third-round draft choice has resumed his strong debut campaign, averaging an impressive 4.7 yards per carry over the past three weeks while adding seven receptions for 75 yards. What is most encouraging in regards to his fantasy outlook is the massive uptick in workload, as Singletary's 20 rush attempts Sunday nearly tripled his previous season high of seven carries. Upcoming next is a matchup against a Cleveland defense that entered Week 9 ranking as a bottom-10 unit with more than 110 rushing yards surrendered per game to opposing running backs.",

The 26-year-old benefited immensely from positive field position; his first touchdown was essentially set up following a blocked punt midway through the third quarter, while the second came after the Packers forced a Chargers field goal near the goal line late in the fourth,. However, an offside penalty on the latter play tempted head coach Anthony Lynn with a 4th-and-inches situation, which Gordon converted into a game-sealing touchdown. Still, Gordon looked explosive and shifty, at one point hurdling over a defender en route to his longest run of the game and his second consecutive contest with a 15-plus yard carries.",

The 29-year-old wasn't being met by defenders until well after the line of scrimmage on most of his runs. The threat of Lamar Jackson's scrambles to the outside spread New England's front seven out more than it has been against other rushing attacks. This strong performance was a welcomed sight for Ingram's fantasy owners, as the power back had really cooled off after leading all fantasy backs in scoring through the first three weeks of the season. While Sunday's results surpassed pregame expectations, Ingram should carry lofty projections heading into a Week 9 contest against the Bengals' NFL-worst rushing defense.",

Backfield mate Matt Breida took control of the backfield Thursday by turning 15 carries into 78 yards, but the timeshare between the two backs should continue in a fairly even split on the majority of weeks. Coleman tied his lowest rushing total of the season with Thursday's tally, so he'll look to bounce back against the Seahawks in a Week 10 divisional matchup a week from Monday.",

Considering the Chargers never trailed, it was a bit of an odd game script for Ekeler, but the shifty back capitalized on a molasses-like Packers' linebacking corps, routinely cutting and knifing his way for additional yards after contact. This was the first game since Gordon's return from a contract holdout that the duo has each gone over 40-plus total yards, so it should come as a genuine shock to see both combine for 202 yards. Most of the credit should go to the dreadfully bad Packers defense, but it's possible Ekeler and Gordon could have a similarly effective day next week against the Raiders.",

    "analysis": "Freeman is in the second season of a five-year, $41.25 million extension, playing for a team that has no realistic chance to make the playoffs. He's on pace for a 70-544-6 receiving line, but he already has fumbled three times (losing two) and is averaging a career-worst 3.4 yards per carry. It isn't entirely clear that Freeman has a future in Atlanta beyond 2019, though the failure to complete a trade might be taken as a hint in that direction. Either way, he should retain his lead role in the backfield when the Falcons come back from their Week 9 bye for a nightmarish Week 10 matchup in New Orleans.",

Though the stats don't show it, Sunday was actually Gurley's most efficient game since Week 1 -- the first time in that span in which he averaged at least four yards per carry. The Georgia product has not reached 75 total yards in a game since the opener, but he's scored in all but one game during that stretch. Gurley doesn't seem like he's going to manhandle defenses like he used to, but he retains good value by inevitably piling up red-zone touches and picking up a score. Gurley has a whopping 15 red-zone touches over his last two games.",

Due to his lack of receptions, Mack is reliant on finding paydirt to turn in big fantasy performances. However, he is in line for a strong matchup against Miami in Week 10, particularly if the Colts are forced to turn to Brian Hoyer as their quarterback.",

He hasn't been lifted to the 53-man roster yet, but the official move will come before Sunday. In this past Sunday's loss to the Broncos, lead back Nick Chubb was taken off the field multiple times, but Dontrell Hilliard wasn't successful with just eight yards on five carries. The Browns hope Hunt can add another dimension to the backfield and form a one-two punch with Chubb. While Chubb is locked into the No. 1 role for the foreseeable future, it wouldn't be surprising if the Browns afforded Hunt a handful of touches right away. Hunt's potential is evident, as he racked up 1,202 yards from scrimmage and 14 total touchdowns over 11 games with the Chiefs last year.",

If Johnson is in fact cleared to play, it's not guaranteed he would take back a leading role immediately after backfield newcomer Kenyan Drake proved adept both on the ground (15 carries for 110 yards and a touchdown) and through the air (four receptions for 52 yards) against a tough Niners defense in his team debut.",

Despite his lack of involvement, he had a chance to score a touchdown on one of his rushing attempts, but he was ruled out of bounds just short of the goal line. He's averaging just 30 yards per game with only one touchdown, and his combination of a low floor and low ceiling makes him a difficult player to trust in fantasy lineups, though he has slightly elevated value in point-per-reception leagues.",

    "analysis": "His fourth-quarter score didn't affect the outcome, but it did extend Williams' streak of games with a receiving TD to four. His six targets were also a season high, in part due to the Packers' offensive line struggling to protect Aaron Rodgers and the QB needing to get rid of the ball quickly. Williams stands a good chance of being productive again next week against a Panthers defense that has been vulnerable to RBs, both on the ground and through the air, all year.",

    "analysis": "For the second straight game, Murray was exceptional in Alvin Kamara's (ankle/knee) stead, eclipsing the century mark on the ground and contributing plenty through the air as well. Murray scored his third rushing touchdown over the last two games with an eight-yard run in the second quarter, and he then went in from 15 yards out on a pass from Drew Brees with 5:25 remaining in the third period. Murray's receiving tally was also a season best, and his reception total was second only to that of Michael Thomas on the afternoon. Kamara likely will be ready to return Week 10 against the Falcons after the bye week, but Murray has certainly made a case for a consistent, workload even when both backs are healthy.",

He also made an impact as a pass catcher, leading the backfield in receiving yardage thanks in part to a 26-yard touchdown reception late in the fourth quarter. McKissic certainly outperformed Ty Johnson in this one and could play a larger role in next Sunday's road matchup with the Bears.",

Granted, Kyler Murray attempted just 24 passes, and seven of Kirk's teammates also tallied at least one catch. Additionally, Kirk may have been impacted by playing two games in the span of five days after sitting out three weeks due to an ankle injury. In any case, he'll have plenty of time to rest up for the Cardinals' next contest on Sunday, Nov. 10 at Tampa Bay.",

    "report": "Hill brought in six of eight targets for 140 yards and a touchdown in the Chiefs' 26-23 win over the Vikings on Sunday. He also rushed once for five yards.",
    "analysis": "Hill demonstrated he didn't necessarily need Patrick Mahomes under center to thrive, exploding for his first 100-yard effort of the season and notching a 41-yard catch in the process. The versatile speedster also opened the scoring with a 40-yard touchdown grab and now has four receiving scores since returning from his early-season collarbone injury. Hill should have Mahomes back under center Week 10 against the Titans, affording him a good opportunity to put together a second consecutive strong performance.",

    "analysis": "Green was spotted on the practice field Wednesday, but the extent of his participation isn't entirely clear, as the Bengals don't need to release an injury report during their bye week. The wideout met with the media afterward, saying he hopes to stay with the Bengals beyond 2019 but doesn't want to receive the franchise tag this coming offseason, per Paul Dehner Jr. of The Athletic. Per Dehner, Green also mentioned that he understands the team's decision to move rookie quarterback Ryan Finley into the starting lineup in place of Andy Dalton. The change under center is bad news for Green's fantasy value, though the Bengals could eventually switch back to Dalton if the rookie doesn't look good the next few weeks.",

Godwin did check in second in receptions, receiving yards and targets to Evans, but he was once again utilized in much closer proximity to the line of scrimmage on his way to 8.7 yards per grab. While his final line wasn't particularly remarkable, Godwin did see a good bump in production after mustering a more modest 4-43 line in Week 8 versus the Titans. He'll look to boost his numbers further versus the Cardinals in Week 10.",

The Rams have a lot of weapons on offense even if Brandin Cooks (concussion) misses some time, but Kupp has been on a different level this season while leading the team in catches, targets, yards and touchdowns as Jared Goff's security blanket. He's had at least 10 targets in five of eight games this season. After beating up on the hapless Bengals, Kupp and the Rams get the Steelers after the bye.",

    "analysis": "Despite facing one of the weaker pass defenses in the league, Mitchell Trubisky threw for just 125 yards, which certainly limited any upside for Robinson. He had an opportunity for potential long touchdown after he ran past the cornererback, but Trubisky underthrew the pass, resulting in an incompletion. This was the first time he posted fewer than 60 yards since Week 2, and he still should be considered a solid weekly lineup option.",

Of Lockett's 13 receptions, 10 went for either a first down or a touchdown. This performance helped Lockett achieve career highs in receptions (59) and targets (72) through just nine games, numbers he's ringing up at an impressive 81.9 percent catch rate. Lockett's massive target share makes his production sustainable, and fantasy owners should continue plugging him even against a stout 49ers defense in Week 10.",

While this was an encouraging performance from Moore, the Panthers will continue to rely on their defense and run game -- particularly Christian McCaffrey -- to win games, meaning Moore's target volume figures to remain volatile.",

    "analysis": "Brown led the team in both targets and receptions, the second time in the past three weeks he's shown strong rapport with Ryan Tannehill. Still, his effort was a contrast in both good and bad, as he showed the ability to work downfield on a 35-yard reception that was highly contested to begin the fourth quarter. On the other hand, he let a target slip through his hands for an interception that led directly to a Panthers touchdown early in the game. Overall, Brown now has at least seven targets in two of his last three games, far more consistent volume than he saw early in the season.",

Since his breakout Week 7 performance against the Chargers, Davis has managed just six receptions for 57 yards combined across his last two games. A number of factors are working against Davis being a consistent producer, particularly the emergence of Brown and Ryan Tannehill's willingness to spread the ball around to a number of different Titans receivers. The team may ultimately be forced to up their pass volume and run their offense at a faster pace in an effort to earn a victory against the Chiefs in Week 10, potentially opening the door for Davis to produce.",

Much like Antonio Gates in the past, Henry is quickly developing into Rivers' favorite target in the middle of the field, often operating opposite Keenan Allen on crossing patterns to take advantage of both players' expert route-running abilities. Despite receiving 24 targets over the past three games, Henry has yet to record a touchdown since returning from injury in Week 6, losing goal-line opportunities to Melvin Gordon, who has four touchdowns in the past three games.",

    "report": "Hooper hauled in six of seven targets for 65 receiving yards and one touchdown during Sunday's 27-20 loss to Seattle.",
    "analysis": "Hooper has been an absolute fantasy dynamo to the midway point of the 2019 campaign, establishing a pace through eight games that puts him on trajectory for a 100-catch, 1,100-yard and 10-touchdown season. Moreover, if Matt Ryan (ankle) is forced to miss a second consecutive start after the Week 9 bye, it doesn't appear that there will be a massive drop-off in statistical output, given Matt Schaub's 460-yard outing against the Seahawks. Hooper's next matchup comes Nov. 10, when the Falcons travel to take on a Saints defense that entered Week 8 allowing the 10th-fewest receiving yards to opposing tight ends, while surrendering only one touchdown to the position all season.",

Graham's production has been inconsistent all season, but with that being the case for many tight ends and him scoring three times -- as many or more than all but three other TEs -- he has done just enough to be considered as a standard-league starter at his position. That may not be the case in Week 10, however, as the Packers will face a Panthers defense that has routinely shut down opposing tight ends over its first eight games.",

It's possible that this had to do with Baltimore's run-heavy game plan where the Ravens ran the ball 41 times while attempting just 23 attempts. With Nick Boyle (59 snaps) and Hayden Hurst (29 snaps) regarded as better blockers than Andrews, it's not entirely surprising that Andrews would take a backseat in that type of game script. Andrews came up big when called upon, however, as his 18-yard reception over Terrance Brooks on third down midway through the third quarter helped set up a touchdown that put the Ravens up by two scores. Andrews figures to see a larger role Sunday against the Bengals in a game where Baltimore won't need to shy away from the Cincinnati secondary.",

    "analysis": "Hollister hauled in a one-yard touchdown pass from Russell Wilson late in the second quarter, and he nearly scored again in the third quarter but was stopped at Tampa Bay's one-yard line. He was saving his second score for a heroic moment, however, as Hollister snagged a 10-yard pass from Russell Wilson in overtime for a touchdown and the win, lifting the Seahawks to 7-2 on the season. This success may be unsustainable in the long term, but Hollister does have fantasy value, albeit in a touchdown-dependent capacity. Hollister may end up passing Luke Willson in the tight-end pecking order in Week 10's matchup against the 49ers, but both players could see a decrease in potential once Josh Gordon is in the fold.",

However, Delanie Walker (ankle) is making progress toward a return, and if he were able to suit up in Week 10 against the Chiefs, it would only further dent Smith's potential value.",
