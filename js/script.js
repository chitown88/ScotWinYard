    "headlineNews": "Patriots' Cam Newton: Named starting QB",
    "report": "Newton has been named the Patriots' starting quarterback, Jim McBride of the Boston Globe reports.Per the report, the decision was confirmed during a team meeting Thursday. This was an expected outcome, given how well Newton has reportedly adjusted to running the New England offense. With that, he'll be backed up by Jarrett Stidham, with Brian Hoyer likely to stick around as the team's third QB. When healthy, Newton is a dynamic dual-threat quarterback, and offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels should find creative ways to take advantage of the 31-year-old's considerable talents, though it should be noted that the team's pass-catching corps heading into the 2020 season remains a work in progress.",

Meanwhile, the O-line is front of him has been reshuffled due to season-ending injuries to LT Andre Dillard and RG Brandon Brooks, who have been replaced by Jason Peters and a player to be named later, respectively. The Eagles' skill positions also are banged up, with Miles Sanders (lower body), Jalen Reagor (upper body) and Alshon Jeffery (foot) all in various stages of recovery. At the very least, though, Wentz is back and working with what's available to him as the team prepares for the season opener.",

Wilson also happens to have the best receiving corps of his career, with Tyler Lockett and DK Metcalf forming a formidable duo at wide receiver while Greg Olsen and Will Dissly (Achilles) figure to get most of the targets at tight end. Seahawks OC Brian Schottenheimer  has taken a lot of heat for his run-heavy approach, but he did find a better balance last season, with Wilson jumping from 427 pass attempts in 2018 to 516 in 2019. Another increase isn't out of the question, as Wilson has now reached a 65 percent completion rate and 8.0 YPA in back-to-back seasons.",

    "report": "Brees focused on his arm strength this offseason while working with throwing coach Tom House, ESPN.com's Mike Triplett reports.According to ESPN Stats &amp; Information, Brees has completed only one pass that traveled more than 35 yards past the line of scrimmage since 2017. Part of that relates to personnel, strategy and his efficiency on shorter passes, but it also seems the 41-year-old quarterback is acknowledging that reduced arm strength has been a factor. The completion percentage king is hoping to complete more long throws in 2020, though his core group of pass catchers -- Michael Thomas, Alvin Kamara, Emmanuel Sanders and Jared Cook -- is better suited to short and intermediate routes. The Saints do have Tre'Quan Smith as a potential deep threat to replace Ted Ginn, who signed with Chicago this past offseason. While there's been ample speculation 2020 will be his final NFL season, Brees has not yet decided if that will be the case.",

After a highly productive first week-plus of on-field work, Arians decided to give Brady a proverbial veteran's day off from the daily late-summer grind, jokingly noting he expects his quarterback to be \"fresh as daisies\" when he gets back to work Sunday.",

    "report": "As expected, Fitzpatrick will begin the season as Miami's starting quarterback, Cameron Wolfe of ESPN.com reports.This outcome isn't surprising, but it's notable that first-round draft pick Tua Tagovailoa was deemed healthy enough to serve as the team's No. 2 signal-caller, prompting a parting of ways with Josh Rosen. For now, the Dolphins figure to proceed gradually with Tagovailoa, who's bouncing back from a major hip injury he suffered last November, especially with this year's abridged offseason in mind. Meanwhile, fellow QB Jake Rudock is on Miami's practice squad. The 37-year-old Fitzpatrick thus represents an option in deeper fantasy formats, but Miami's pass-catching corps isn't especially deep, so his upside out of the gate hinges on how well he clicks with the likes of wideouts DeVante Parker and Preston Williams, as well as tight end Mike Gesicki.",

On the bright side, Big Ben says the pain has not returned since having elbow surgery during the offseason. Given the subpar performances of Mason Rudolph and Devlin Hodges in relief of Roethlisberger in 2019, the Steelers would likely settle for a fraction of the career-high 5,129 passing yards and 34 touchdowns he tossed in 2018.",

    "headlineNews": "49ers' Jimmy Garoppolo: Still wearing light brace",
    "report": "Garoppolo is still wearing \"a light brace,\" contradicting a previous report that the QB was brace-free, Eric Branch of the San Francisco Chronicle reports.The distinction hardly matters, as Garoppolo was excellent last season while wearing a brace. Perhaps his mundane rushing total (62 yards in 2019) could improve once the 28-year-old officially sheds the brace, and it's entirely possible the team is just being overcautious with its star QB, allowing Garoppolo to have the full extent of his mobility come the regular season. With George Kittle locked down to a long-term extension Thursday, Garoppolo should be poised for another successful season, especially if Deebo Samuel, who had offseason surgery on his foot, returns closer to the start of the season as expected.",

    "report": "Rivers was 19-for-28 passing in Monday's scrimmage at Lucas Oil Stadium. He targeted T.Y. Hilton for five receptions and has been frequently looking for running backs and tight ends in the passing game, Kevin Bowen of 93.5 FM The Fan Indianapolis reports.While it's hard to read too much into a scrimmage, reports on Rivers in training camp have been positive so far. He appears to be building a rapport with Hilton, though he didn't particularly target any other receivers in Monday's scrimmage. Rivers has been seen throwing a high percentage of his passes on shorter routes to running backs and tight ends, which could be a sign of a focus on taking what the defense gives him after his turnover issues last season (20 interceptions).",

    "report": "Cousins has displayed increased accuracy as training camp has progressed, Arif Hasan of The Athletic reports.Cousins has a number of incumbent receivers to throw to, most notably Adam Thielen, but the offseason trade of Stefon Diggs to the Bills has opened up a significant number of reps. Rookie first-round pick Justin Jefferson likely is the long-term answer as the No. 2 WR, but 2019 seventh-rounder Bisi Johnson has been working ahead of him so far in camp. During two campaigns with Diggs on board, Cousins completed a healthy 68.7 percent of his passes and averaged 7.5 yards per attempt, marks that could be less stable as he incorporates Jefferson into what remains a run-heavy scheme.",

Higbee's late-season breakout last year has been well documented, and Everett caught a touchdown pass from Goff during red-zone drills Wednesday. The pair could quickly prove to be reliable options for the 26-year-old quarterback again in 2020. Additionally, It's easy to forget that Goff's entering just his fourth full season as a starter, and his pricey contract often fogs over his serviceable fantasy production the past three years.",

    "headlineNews": "Packers' Aaron Rodgers: Same old, same old in camp",
    "report": "Rodgers has looked like his usual self during Packers training camp, Matt Schneidman of The Athletic reports.Rodgers may not have the receiving depth he'd like, but if his on-field play of late is any indication he hasn't lost a step. At Sunday's practice in particular, he connected with Davante Adams and Jake Kumerow on back-to-back 40-plus-yard touchdowns before closing the session with a two-minute drill that concluded with a successful 47-yard field goal by Mason Crosby. Due to the makeup of the skill-position ranks, the Packers may run more than ever for a Rodgers-led squad with Aaron Jones, Jamaal Williams and rookie second-round pick AJ Dillon composing the backfield. Still, the aforementioned Adams is on board, Allen Lazard came on strong last year as the No. 2 WR, and a variety of young talent otherwise populates the wide receiver and tight end ranks.",

It's been great to go through installs for the first time and put everything under our belt for the first time. We're really starting to make progress, which needs to happen. We know the sense of urgency is at an all-time high.\" Mayfield also called out his building rapport with new tight ends Austin Hooper and Harrison Bryant, which he said have a chance to be special.",

Training-camp footage from HBO's \"Hard Knocks\" hinted at Justin Herbert having some trouble learning coordinator Shane Steichen's offense, whereas Taylor is a 10-year veteran who already spent one season working with Steichen in Los Angeles. Herbert should still have a decent chance of making starts before the end of the season, but Taylor should have a pretty long leash early in the year.",

    "report": "Prescott will play under the Cowboys' franchise tag during the 2020 season after failing to reach a long-term extension with the team prior to Wednesday's deadline.Prescott is now slated to earn $31.4 million in 2020 after signing the franchise tender back in late June, per Todd Archer of ESPN.com The two sides won't be able to open up extension talks until after the coming season, and it's possible that Prescott could play under the franchise tag again in 2021. In any case, the 26-year-old -- who logged a career high 4,902 passing yards in 2019 -- will continue to helm a Dallas offense that also features a strong wideout nucleus featuring Amari Cooper, Michael Gallup and first-round draft pick CeeDee Lamb, as well as a top-tier running back in Ezekiel Elliott.",

    "report": "Bridgewater has shown good mobility and an improving rapport with wideout Robby Anderson early in training camp, Jonathan M. Alexander of The Charlotte Observer reports.Bridgewater certainly won't be mistaken for a former track star, but the quarterback is capable of scampering for a first down here and there. More importantly, it's the turbo-charged Anderson whose speed has impressed at camp thus far, as he's reportedly gotten consistent separation and has emerged as a favorite target of Bridgewater. With D.J. Moore, Curtis Samuel and Christian McCaffrey also ranking among his top weapons, Bridgewater undoubtedly has a dynamic set of pass catchers at his disposal as he re-familiarizes himself with offensive coordinator Joe Brady this season.",

The second-year pro may be the shortest starting quarterback in the league, but his ability to withstand hits doesn't seem to be a major point of concern. While their offensive line remains a potential weak point, the Cardinals could take a big step forward on offense with DeAndre Hopkins climbing aboard for Year 2 of the Kingsbury/Murray project.",

    "report": "Ryan and the Falcons have a 2020 schedule that boasts a number of potentially high-scoring contests, including out-of-division games against the Cowboys, Packers, Chiefs and Seahawks, Will McFadden of the team's official site reports.McFadden's article highlighted Ryan's excellence in 115 career games during which the quarterback was asked to throw the ball at least 40 times. Per Pro Football Focus, Ryan earned a performance grade of 75 or higher in 33.9 percent of those contests, good for the 10th-best rate among QBs with at least 25 such appearances since 2006. Not that Atlanta won't already be involved in a number of high-scoring shootouts playing in a division with Drew Brees and Tom Brady, but cross-conference dates with the talented AFC West further indicate an offense-intensive slate of games. Ryan has attempted 600-plus passes each of the past two seasons, and if Atlanta's young secondary struggles in 2020 as many suspect it will, the veteran QB's fantasy value many spike as a byproduct.",

Lock impressed during his five-start audition to end the 2019 season with quarterback ratings of over 90 in three games despite playing with a depleted offensive line and little in the way of skill players. Expectations must be tempered as Lock is playing in a new scheme with a lot of young faces. Still, the early reports have been that rookies Jerry Jeudy and Lloyd Cushenberry are impressing, and Lock is responding well to Pat Shurmur's scheme. Any sort of gelling at this stage should prompt excitement.",

An offseason minus on-field reps adds a degree of difficulty to Burrow's transition to the pro game, but the LSU product will at least have a solid collection of wideouts to throw to once training camp practices commence. The group is headed by A.J. Green, with Tyler Boyd, John Ross and rookie Tee Higgins also in the mix.",

    "report": "Head coach Matt Nagy announced that Trubisky will start Week 1 versus the Lions, Jeff Dickerson of ESPN reports.The news was leaked a couple of days prior to the official announcement, but now it's set in stone that Trubisky will be afforded another opportunity to live up to his second-overall selection in the 2017 NFL Draft. Nagy emphasized multiple times that Trubisky won the competition on his own merit, relaying that the quarterback improved his footwork, accuracy and command this offseason. Nevertheless, his performance in 2019 was uninspiring with 3,138 yards, 17 touchdowns and 10 interceptions over 15 games, and if he begins the year with the same caliber of play, Nagy could quickly shift to backup QB Nick Foles, who apparently had a strong camp as well.",

    "report": "Carr has looked sharp throughout training camp, with no hint of Marcus Mariota making a push for the starting job, Vic Tafur of The Athletic reports.Carr established career highs in a slew of passing categories last year, but the Raiders missed out on the playoffs for a fifth time in his six pro seasons, with their offense struggling in the red zone (52.8 TD percentage - 22nd) and their defense struggling in every area of the field. Mariota is the highest-paid backup QB in the league, so while he may not have a shot at the Week 1 starting job, he could be called in as a midseason replacement if Carr isn't playing well or the Raiders aren't in the mix for a playoff spot. Rookie wideouts Henry Ruggs and Bryan Edwards should help Carr's cause, but it appears Tyrell Williams (torn shoulder labrum) will be trying to play through an injury for the second year in a row.",

On the other hand, it isn't clear if newcomer Breshad Perriman will be an upgrade or downgrade from Robby Anderson (now with the Panthers) out wide, nor is it clear that second-round pick Denzel Mims will be ready to contribute out of the gate. Darnold may once again find that slot receiver Jamison Crowder is his most reliable target, especially if tight end Chris Herndon doesn't rebound the way the Jets are hoping. All in all, it's one of the weaker rosters of skill players in the league, but there is at least reason to think Darnold can improve his own play in his age-23 season.",

Bills coach Sean McDermott later stated that this was a good dry run for the team in terms of surprises that may happen in an unusual NFL year.",

    "report": "McCaffrey hauled in the only touchdown of Panthers practice Tuesday, Joseph Person of The Athletic reports.During a red-zone drill, McCaffrey lined up in the slot against linebacker Shaq Thompson. Running a \"Lucy\" route, McCaffrey darted toward Thompson and decided to go outside toward the right corner of the end zone, where he made an over-the-shoulder catch from Teddy Bridgewater near the back pylon. McCaffrey's record-setting 2019 season happened while working with three different quarterbacks, so the stability of Bridgewater could create even more opportunities for the running back to succeed. In the coming campaign, McCaffrey will be looking to follow up an offseason in which he became the highest-paid RB in NFL history.",

Though the lower-body injury cost Sanders significant practice time during training camp, the Eagles remain optimistic that he'll be ready to headline the team's backfield in Sunday's season opener against Washington. If Sanders' recovery doesn't progress as expected and he ends up sitting out the Week 1 matchup or taking on a more limited workload than normal, Boston Scott and Corey Clement would be in store for heightened roles.",

In the meantime, the possibility remains that contract talks could resume down the road, and the Vikings will have the option of using their franchise tag on Cook next season.",

    "report": "Jones has looked \"fast, decisive and explosive\" during training camp, according to Wes Hodkiewicz of the Packers' official site.Coming off the best season of his three-year career -- 1,558 yards from scrimmage and 19 total touchdowns -- Jones had entered the upper tier of do-it-all running backs as the offseason kicked off. The development didn't stop the Packers from selecting AJ Dillon in the second round of the 2020 draft, which left the backfield in the hands of Jones, Jamaal Williams and the 6-0, 247-pound rookie. It should be noted Jones and Williams are heading into the final year of their rookie deals, so Dillon can be considered insurance at the least and a threat to touches, especially in short-yardage situations. Regarding this last point, Jones may lose some of his 34 runs and 12 targets in the red zone from 2019, thereby lowering his ceiling.",

    "report": "Mixon (head) and the Bengals have reached agreement on a four-year contract extension, Adam Schefter of ESPN reports.Ian Rapoport of NFL Network reports the contract is worth $48 million over four years, keeping the 2017 second-round pick under team control through 2024. With that out of the way, Mixon won't have any issue taking on a large workload this season, hoping to pick up where he left off over the second half of last year. Migraines have kept him out of practice for more than a week now, but he has made some appearances as an observer from the sidelines.",

    "report": "Ingram is expected to retain his starting job, but the workload could vary from week to week, Jeff Zrebiec of The Athletic  reports.Ingram landed in the 12-to-16-carry range in 12 of his 15 regular-season games last year, consistently operating as the lead back ahead of Gus Edwards. The addition of second-round pick J.K. Dobbins makes things a bit more complicated this season, and while the Ravens are a decent bet to lead the league in rushing again, it's also fair to assume Lamar Jackson will account for a big chunk of that production. Now entering the second season of a three-year, $15 million contract, Ingram isn't likely to match his fantasy value from 2019.",

Mack was also seen having a strong camp and improved on his receiving skills. While Taylor ultimately may win a majority of touches in the backfield, Mack looks set to be the first running back on the field. Still, the Indy coaching staff has continued to say they view their backfield as a committee with both Mack and Taylor as a \"one-two punch.\"",

    "headlineNews": "Cowboys' Ezekiel Elliott: Working on receiving skills",
    "report": "Elliott focused on pass catching this offseason, Michael Gehlken of The Dallas Morning News reports.Elliott says he didn't spend much time on backfield work, instead focusing on his technique lining up out wide or in the slot. Perhaps he's feeling some pressure from backfield mate Tony Pollard, who had 1,292 receiving yards in three seasons at Memphis and could eventually be an option to replace Elliott on passing downs. It sounds like Zeke is doing everything in his power to retain a three-down role, following three consecutive seasons with snap share in the 84-89 percent range. It is possible Pollard takes a larger chunk of the snaps in his second pro season, but it'll still be Elliott dominating the rushing workload at the very least. In other news, the 25-year-old seems to have made a complete recovery from his summer bout with COVID-19.",

    "report": "Kamara and the Saints are \"extremely close\" to coming to terms on a contract extension, which is expected to be finalized before New Orleans' season opener Sunday versus the Buccaneers, Adam Schefter of ESPN reports.Heading into the final year of his rookie deal, Kamara's contract status has been a hot topic in training camp, though the running back himself indicated that his recent four-day absence from practice wasn't due to any dissatisfaction with his current deal. In any case, a long-term deal with the Saints would erase any lingering concern about Kamara entertaining a holdout or being traded ahead of Week 1, a development that would likely have many fantasy managers feeling better about the first-round pick they invested into the 25-year-old. Kamara is on track to continue heading the Saints' ground game in 2020 while serving as one of the NFL's most prolific receivers out of the backfield, and he'll once again have the luxury of working behind a top-tier offensive line.",

    "headlineNews": "Giants' Saquon Barkley: Works at Friday's scrimmage",
    "report": "Barkley (undisclosed) worked a number of offensive units during Friday's intrasquad scrimmage, Pat Leonard of the New York Daily News reports.Barkley came up limping after attempting to break a tackle at Monday's practice, but his presence in the lineup Friday indicates he's more or less healthy. During one possession in particular, he sandwiched two short rushes around a 15-yard catch and run for a first down, per Paul Dottino of the Giants' official site. With his all-around skill set on display, Barkley again is considered one of the top fantasy assets as he looks to avoid the injuries that set him back a bit last season.",

    "report": "Washington listed Gibson as the No. 2 running back on the unofficial depth chart the team released Tuesday, Nicki Jhabvala of The Washington Post reports.J.D. McKissic sits atop the depth chart heading into Week 1, but his presence there doesn't necessarily mean he'll take Washington's first snap or lead the backfield in carries and touches in Sunday's season opener versus the Eagles. Instead, Washington is expected to make use of a committee of running backs that includes McKissic, Gibson, Peyton Barber and Bryce Love. The latter two backs will likely see most of their use in pure running situations, while McKissic's skills as a pass catcher could allow him to see steady work on three downs. During his final year at Memphis in 2019, Gibson excelled both as a runner (11.2 yards per carry on 33 totes) and receiver (38 receptions for 735 yards and eight scores), so the rookie third-round pick seemingly has the best potential among Washington's four backs to emerge as a three-down option. The uncertainty regarding Gibson's workload early on will make it difficult to depend on him in Week 1 fantasy lineups.",

    "report": "It still isn't clear how the Bills' backfield workload will be split between Singletary and Zack Moss, according to Joe Buscaglia of The Athletic.Singletary was an effective runner throughout his rookie season and showed development as a receiving threat late in the year, but he also fumbled four times and apparently wasn't consistent in pass protection. The 223-pound Moss is a better bet to handle short-yardage work, but Singletary still figures to be the nominal starter and quite possibly the lead runner. Reports of fumbling issues at camp were probably overblown, as it was only two instances through seven practices, and we haven't heard any evidence the problem continued. For what it's worth, Singletary had only five fumbles on 765 touches in his college career, and Moss had only six on 778 touches.",

    "report": "Montgomery (groin) is expected to be out for 2-to-4 weeks, giving him a shot to be ready for Chicago's season opener against Detroit, Ian Rapoport of NFL Network reports.With the opener two an a half weeks away, this timeline suggests Montgomery is more likely to miss the game than suit up. He suffered a groin strain Wednesday, slipping on the practice field while taking a hand-off from Mitchell Trubisky. Initial reports stirred up fear of a knee ligament injury, but it turned out to be something much less serious, albeit still a threat to Montgomery's Week 1 availability. The Bears don't have much depth in their backfield, with passing-down specialist Tarik Cohen joined by Ryan Nall and undrafted rookie Artavis Pierce. Nall was with the team last season, but he played only eight snaps on offense and 137 on special teams. The Bears likely will sign another runner by the end of the week.",

    "report": "Ozigbo is listed as the No. 2 running back on the Jaguars' first unofficial depth chart of the season.After Leonard Fournette was cut last week, coach Doug Marrone told Michael DiRocco of ESPN.com that the Jaguars will take a \"situation- and matchup-based\" approach with the backfield. Prior to the release of the aforementioned depth chart, it was anybody's guess who among Ozigbo and undrafted rookie James Robinson would get the first shot at RB work Week 1 against the Colts. With Robinson in front of Ozigbo, the latter is poised to play second fiddle in the season opener while Chris Thompson takes on most of the pass-catching reps among Jacksonville running backs.",

The former Chiefs standout is expected to play more of a Swiss army knife role that involves lining up both in the backfield and as a receiver at times while Chubb plays a more traditional running back role.",

It makes me want to compete more and do everything I can to prove the doubters [wrong] or want to make [Bill] O'Brien look good and want to make this organization look good.\" The 28-year-old back with a big salary ($11.2 million cap hit) has dealt with injuries the last few seasons, but Johnson showed up in \"fantastic shape,\" per O'Brien.

    "headlineNews": "Jets' Le'Veon Bell: Working in 60/40 split with Gore",
    "report": "Bell has seen approximately 60 percent of the first-team reps in training camp, with Frank Gore handling around 40 percent, according to ESPN.com's Rich Cimini.Bell took 14 snaps to Gore's nine during Saturday's practice, equating to 60.9 percent of the first-team reps. Cimini says that's been the norm throughout training camp, with the exception of Wednesday's practice when coach Adam Gase removed Bell early and cited hamstring tightness as the reason. Bell then disputed reports of any injury and mentioned frustration with a lack of practice reps. It is possible he gets more than 60 percent of the workload once the season begins, though Brian Costello of the NY Post believes Bell hasn't looked good in training camp, regularly being outplayed by both Gore and La'Mical Perine. There's no question Bell will enter Week 1 in the lead role, but most signs point to a reduced workload relative to last season's 20.7 touches per game and 82.4 percent snap share. Of course, the Jets aren't exactly overflowing with offensive weapons, so things could change in a hurry if Bell starts the year strong. He won't get any help from the early schedule, facing the Bills (Week 1), 49ers (W2), Colts (W3) and Broncos (W4).",

    "report": "Edwards-Helaire has avoided making mistakes during camp and has performed well during the reps he's gotten, Nate Taylor of The Athletic reports. \"Clyde has done a great job in the reps that he has gotten,\" said quarterback Patrick Mahomes on Sunday. \"He's playing fast, and he has incredible vision. That's what's been the biggest thing so far.\"Edwards-Helaire won't get the benefit of preseason action to dip his toes into NFL game action, so it will likely be trial by fire come Week 1 with Damien Williams opting out for 2020. Edwards-Helaire seems to be passing tests early in camp, doing his job as a running back, a pass catcher and a pass blocker, with Taylor noting that his biggest mistake to date was not being hydrated enough to participate in full Sunday. With more complex portions of the playbook set to be installed beginning Wednesday, Edwards-Helaire has some more learning ahead before the regular season fires up, but he's positioned well to serve as the team's lead back this season.",

    "report": "Lindsay added 10 pounds of muscle to his frame during the offseason, Troy Renck of Denver 7 News reports.Lindsay faded down the stretch in 2019. After averaging 5.2 yards per carry during the first nine games of the season, he finished with 3.7 yards per tote over his last seven contests. Inexperienced quarterback play and injuries along the offensive line played their part, but the added weight should at least help make Lindsay more durable down the stretch. Lindsay is almost certainly going to see fewer touches in 2020 thanks to the addition of Melvin Gordon, but a bigger frame could help minimize any related decrease in production.",

He's in good position to build on last year's career high 132 carries, now sharing a backfield with Justin Jackson and Joshua Kelley instead of Melvin Gordon. That's not to say Ekeler will be a 20-carry-a-game workhorse, but he does have some chance to match his volume from Weeks 1-4 last season -- 14.0 carries, 6.0 catches per game -- when Gordon was holding out.",

Snell followed the pattern, reportedly losing 12 pounds this offseason, and it sounds like it's paying off in terms of quickness and agility. James Conner is still locked in as the starter and figures to see more of the receiving work, but Snell could carve out his own role subbing in for some carries. The second-year pro is apparently shining in training camp, while Jaylen Samuels is on the roster bubble and Anthony McFarland is in the concussion protocol.",

    "headlineNews": "Bengals' Giovani Bernard: Looking good for backup job",
    "report": "Bernard is one of five running backs remaining on the roster after the Bengals waived Rodney Anderson (knee) on Monday, James Rapien of SI.com reports.Earlier in the offseason, there was some thought the Bengals might end up cutting Bernard to save cap space, but part of that scenario involved either Anderson or Trayveon Williams proving to be a reliable backup to Joe Mixon. It's possible for Williams to make such an impression in the coming weeks, but we haven't seen any suggestion that Bernard is in danger of being released. The 28-year-old signed a two-year extension last September, and while he's coming off the least productive season of his pro career, his solid track record as a pass catcher makes him an appealing backup.",

The addition of Peterson shouldn't change that immediately, but it could have more of an impact as the season rolls on. Johnson has admitted in training camp that he's not as shifty as Swift, so once the rookie gets healthy, this could turn into a committee backfield. If that's the case and Swift takes off as expected, Johnson could be the most affected back by Peterson's presence.",

    "headlineNews": "Raiders' Jalen Richard: Retains third-down role in Vegas",
    "report": "Richard will line up as the No. 2 running back with the Raiders and is also expected to return punts, Tashan Reed of The Athletic reports.Richard faced competition for his pass-catching role in training camp, as the team drafted former wide receiver Lynn Bowden to play running back and signed Theo Riddick in August. However, due to a favorable contract and his own merit, Richard secured the No. 2 job behind Josh Jacobs while Bowden was shipped to Miami. Last season, Derek Carr completed 92 passes to running backs, and Richard accounted for 36 of those receptions while DeAndre Washington logged 36 as well. Washington is no longer with the team, though, so even if Jacobs increases his pass-catching work like he plans, there should be enough volume for Richard to either stay steady or enjoy an increase in targets.",

    "report": "The Patriots could elect to ease Michel back into their backfield mix early on in hte season while he returns from offseason foot surgery, Mike Reiss of ESPN.com reports.That said, such an approach would have been easier to implement had a finger issue not landed Damien Harris on injured reserve. With Harris out for at least three weeks, Michel -- the Patriots' No. 1 back the last two seasons -- figures to head the team's ground game Sunday against the Dolphins. Offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels does have the luxury of being able to dish out touches to change-of-pace back James White and the versatile Rex Burkhead, so it does seem plausible that Michel's usage against Miami could be deliberate, though he's still expected to get the first shot at the bulk of the team's goal-line carries. For his part, Michel notes that his foot has responded well since he was activated from the PUP list Aug. 26, but the 2018 first-rounder acknowledged that he has some catching up to do while adding that he's \"headed in the right direction.\" Either way, even as the franchise moves on from the Tom Brady era, New England's carry allotments are expected to continue to be dictated by game flow and matchup-specific game plans, an often frustrating context for fantasy managers.",

Gone is the willing but often pedestrian Peyton Barber -- Jones' main rival for carries last season -- and a pair of ultra-talented assets in Leonard Fournette and LeSean McCoy are now in the fold and slated to see touches in their own right. While McCoy is likely to primarily handle occasional change-of-pace duty and third-down work, Fournette is about as legitimate a competitor for early-down carries as it gets, and rookie third-round pick Ke'Shawn Vaughn is also waiting in the wings. Consequently, Jones naturally will have to produce in every facet each week to retain his current standing.",

Maiocco also mentions that the veteran tailback was contemplating sitting out the 2020 season due to his sickle cell trait potentially posing a greater risk if he contracted COVID-19. Coleman ultimately decided to play with the support of his family behind him. The 27-year-old rushed for 544 yards (4.0 yards per carry) and six touchdowns over 14 regular-season games in 2019. Coleman will resume his role as part of a run-heavy backfield committee spearheaded by Raheem Mostert under head coach Kyle Shanahan.",

    "headlineNews": "Texans' Duke Johnson: Excited for Year 2 in Houston",
    "report": "Johnson says he's much more comfortable in his second year working with coach Bill O'Brien.Johnson was traded from Cleveland to Houston on Aug. 8 last year, and a hamstring injury prevented him from practicing with his new team until Aug. 20. He went on to spend the entire season in the passing-down half of a timeshare with Carlos Hyde, averaging 4.9 yards on 83 carries and 9.3 yards on 44 receptions. Johnson now finds himself sharing the Houston backfield with another receiving threat rather than a bruiser, after the Texans acquired David Johnson in the offseason. The new-look backfield could lead to Duke seeing fewer targets early on, but it's also worth noting that David has been alternately injured or ineffective for the better part of the past three years. The precise nature of their workload split will be difficult to decipher before Week 1.",

    "report": "Thompson will have a pass-catching role in the Jaguars' committee backfield, Garry Smits of The Florida Times-Union reports.With the Jaguars cutting Leonard Fournette last week, they were left with Thompson, Ryquell Armstead (illness), Devine Ozigbo and James Robinson after cut-down day. Thompson has more experience than the rest of the backs combined, and there's an existing trust between him and offensive coordinator Jay Gruden, as the two spent the last six years together in Washington. The 29-year-old isn't expected to eat into the carries Fournette left behind because he's never logged more than 68 carries in a season, but he's locked into a pass-catching role nonetheless. With the Jaguars defense expected to be a bottom-10 unit, Thompson should have plenty of opportunities to make a fantasy impact in 2020.",

The fourth-year pro ended up reporting for training camp, but Mattison is still one of the more valuable backups in the league, given the nature of Minnesota's offense as well as the reality that Cook has missed multiple games in each of his three NFL seasons. Of course, the Vikings also have Mike Boone and passing-down specialist Ameer Abdullah on their roster, so there's no guarantee of Mattison taking on Cook-like workloads in the event of a Cook injury.",

Marlon Mack is listed as the starter.While rookie Taylor has drawn rave reviews in training camp, head coach Frank Reich has said Mack is still viewed as the starter. Still, the Indy coaching staff has continued to say they view their backfield as a committee with both Mack and Taylor as a \"one-two punch.\" Taylor will need to improve as a receiver to claim a larger share of the touches in the backfield, as he struggled at times with drops in college. He had mixed reports in training camp on his receiving abilities with some drops in scrimmages but also some reports of strong showings in the passing game.",

In addition to the benefit of experience in Andy Reid's offense, Williams reportedly has been the best blocker in practice, and he also has a history of handling some work in short-yardage situations and on passing downs. Of course, a role as the No. 2 back doesn't necessarily mean Williams would take on large workloads in the event of an Edwards-Helaire injury, as the Chiefs might instead opt for a committee.",

There isn't much upside for an early-down bruiser in an offense that's unlikely to be any better than average, but it is possible Barber gets enough carries -- at least initially -- to gum up Antonio Gibson's production. Barber still doesn't offer much appeal as fantasy asset, even if he has a role in the gameplan for Week 1 against Philadelphia.",

Mack and Taylor are expected to be near co-starters, which could leave Hines with a limited number of snaps per game.",

It thus appears Reggie Bonnafon is in serious danger of losing the No. 2 RB job, a role that translated into only 68 offensive snaps and 22 touches last season. It is possible the new coaching staff will take McCaffrey off the field a bit more often, so Davis could be looking at a handful of touches each week if he wins the job battle.",

To that end, Hill said he made wholesale changes to his game this offseason, including becoming a much more reliable pass catcher. Quinn has confirmed that Hill is \"definitely going to be a contributor\" this season based on his play to this point in camp. Hill has established himself as the favorite to win the No. 2 role at running back behind Todd Gurley.",

    "report": "McKinnon has looked sharp running routes through the first few days of training camp, according to Cam Inman of The Mercury News.After missing the past two seasons with knee injuries, McKinnon is already earning praise from starting QB Jimmy Garoppolo, who said the 28-year-old \"runs [routes] differently than most running backs\" and \"has a feel that's like a receiver.\" Passing downs represent McKinnon's clearest path to a significant Week 1 role, considering Raheem Mostert and Tevin Coleman combined for only 41 catches last season. The 49ers have used Kyle Juszczyk as the lone back on third downs at times, and while his reliable hands and blocking make the fullback a reasonable choice for that role, he can't come close to matching McKinnon's speed and agility. The team also has Jeff Wilson, JaMycal Hasty and Salvon Ahmed hoping to earn depth roles, so McKinnon could be on the roster bubble if his strong start to camp doesn't hold up.",

    "report": "Dobbins is listed as the No. 4 running back on Baltimore's depth chart.Fellow 2020 draft pick Patrick Queen is listed as a starter at inside linebacker, so it can't be said that the Ravens are universally deferring to veterans on their initial depth chart. However, reports from training camp suggested Dobbins was both busy and impressive on the practice field, and coach John Harbaugh said last week that he expects the rookie to have a significant role on offense. In all likelihood, Dobbins is still in line to take some carries Week 1 against the Browns, presumably mixing in behind starter Mark Ingram. Just to be safe, fantasy managers should check back Sunday morning after inactive lists are released, as there's a decent chance Baltimore will have one of its four running backs among the healthy scratches. Gus Edwards and Justice Hill are the other options, but it is possible Dobbins could be the scratch if the offensive gameplan revolves around Ingram while the other two guys are scheduled for significant work on special teams. Either way, Ingram is the smarter fantasy choice for Week 1.",

    "report": "Cohen is focused on taking better care of his body this year, Colleen Kane of The Chicago Tribune reports.Cohen hasn't missed a game in three pro seasons, but he said he he deteriorated down the stretch in 2019 while dealing with tightness in his hips and lower back. He hopes changes in his training routine and diet will lead to a rebound in the final season of his rookie contract, coming off a disappointing 2019 campaign in which a career-high 104 targets produced only 456 receiving yards and three touchdowns. David Montgomery is set to lead the Chicago backfield in carries again, but that doesn't mean Cohen can't push toward triple-digit targets and 50-to-100 carries.",

    "report": "It isn't clear how the Bills will split playing time between Moss and Devin Singletary, but it does seem that Moss is more likely to get goal-line touches, according to Joe Buscaglia of The Athletic.The report kind of hints at a traditional thunder/lightning backfield split, though Singletary wins with agility and vision more so than speed, while Moss is surprisingly nimble in the passing game for a 5-foot-9, 223-pound running back. In other words, both players appear reasonably versatile, which makes it tougher to get a read on the exact nature of their respective roles. It still isn't clear if Singletary's lead role from late last season will carry over to Week 1 against the Jets, as it's also possible Moss forces something closer to a 50/50 split right out of the gate. The Buffalo backfield will be one of the major fantasy storylines for the opening week of the season.",

Note that the Bills seem to tweak the bottom of their roster more than the average team, so Yeldon is no sure thing to last the entire season.

Slot work wouldn't be anything new, as Pro Football Focus shows that Chark logged 24 percent of his routes and 17.5 percent of his targets from an inside alignment last season, catching 13 of 20 passes for 205 yards and four touchdowns. He produced 1.43 yards per route run from the slot, compared to 1.78 YPRR on all other snaps. An ankle injury slowed Chark down in December and forced him to limp across the finish line for a 1,000-yard season, but he otherwise enjoyed a second-year breakout, catching 67 passes for 956 yards and eight touchdowns through his first 13 games. He appears locked in as the No. 1 receiver, leaving Chris Conley, Dede Westbrook, Keelan Cole and rookie Laviska Shenault to compete for snaps at the other two receiver spots.",

    "report": "Beckham reports he's \"definitely feeling a lot better\" this preseason than he did in 2019, Anthony Poisal of the Browns' official site reports.Beckham has made a few athletic catches during camp, including a snatch of a deep ball while out-jumping double coverage. \"It was a heck of a play by Odell,\" offensive coordinator Alex Van Pelt said. \"We are going to give Odell and those receivers as many chances. That was one of the ones that stands out, but there have been three or four more in practice where we just give those guys a chance to catch the ball, put it in play and give them opportunities to make a play.\" Beckham was obviously hampered in 2019 by a core injury that limited him to a career-low in yards per game (64.7). A healthy Beckham will have a big role even if the team leans more on Nick Chubb and the running attack.",

Orlando Ledbetter of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.The 31-year-old wideout has missed only four games over the past six seasons despite frequently showing up on the injury report. It's fair to wonder if age and the accumulation of ailments might eventually catch up with him, but that wasn't the case last season when he topped 90 receiving yards per game for a sixth consecutive year. Jones is locked in as one of the top options at his position, typically going in the second round of fantasy drafts.",

Evans has made several difficult catches look easy in the first few throwing sessions of camp, and the Pro-Bowl receiver has worked open on multiple occasions when Brady's initial reads haven't been there. Vitali separately reports Evans also impressed with a one-handed catch from Brady on Sunday, lending credence to the notion the work the two put in during informal workouts at Berkeley Preparatory School in June is paying dividends.",

    "report": "McLaurin (concussion) has been working out in Virginia with teammates Dwayne Haskins, Steven Sims and Kelvin Harmon, Zach Selby of the Redskins' official site reports.Each of the four was a rookie last season and a key part of the Washington passing game late in the year. McLaurin, of course, was by far the most impressive of the bunch, putting up 409 yards and five touchdowns through his first five games en route to finishing the year with 919 receiving yards in 14 appearances. He missed Week 17 with a concussion, but there hasn't been any suggestion that the head injury impacted his offseason routine. While Sims and Harmon may need to battle for roles during training camp, McLaurin appears locked in as the No. 1 receiver under new offensive coordinator Scott Turner.",

The development backs up coach Matt Nagy's official stance on the matter, calling his level of concern \"low\" last Tuesday, per Jeff Dickerson of ESPN.com. Now back on the field, Robinson can continue to make inroads on a potential contract extension after finishing last season third in the NFL with 154 targets, leading to the second 1,000-yard season of his six-year career.",

    "report": "Smith-Schuster changed his routine this offseason, working one-on-one with a trainer instead of working out with a group of players, Brooke Pryor of ESPN.com reports.Prior to last year, Smith-Schuster never seemed to have any problem with strength, conditioning or durability, playing 40 games in three seasons at USC and 30 during his first two years with the Steelers. He then missed four weeks last season after he suffered a knee sprain and a concussion, adding injury to insult amidst a highly disappointing campaign. Ben Roethlisberger's return to the starting lineup puts Smith-Schuster on track for a rebound in the final year of his rookie contract, though it remains to be seen if the 38-year-old QB can match his pre-injury form. Smith-Schuster claims he isn't worried about signing a new contract, and it wouldn't come as any surprise if the Steelers were to announce an extension before Week 1. Absent a new deal, Smith-Schuster will be a top candidate for the franchise tag next spring.",

The 33-year-old has apparently not lost a step despite the long layoff. He can be quite productive when on the field, as evidenced by his eight-catch, 154-yard, two-touchdown performance in Week 1 of last year; however, his main concern is staying healthy.",

    "report": "Thielen had three receptions for 67 yards in Friday's dress rehearsal scrimmage at U.S. Bank Stadium, Will Ragatz of Sports Illustrated reports. Thielen has looked in top form in training camp and was the best player on the field during the scrimmage, Dane Mizutani of the St. Paul Pioneer Press adds.Thielen's 2019 season was derailed by a hamstring injury in Week 7 and he had just three receptions the final nine games. However, he rebounded in the playoffs, hauling in 12 of 16 targets for 179 yards in two games. Following the Vikings' trade of Stefon Diggs this offseason, Thielen is destined to see plenty of targets in his age-30 season, presumably opposite first-round pick Justin Jefferson. It's encouraging to hear that he's back to top form in training camp and again the top target in the passing offense.",

Now entering his second year in Bevell's system, Golladay could benefit from the continuity of being in the same offense that allowed the 26-year-old to lead the NFL with 36 targets on throws 20 or more yards downfield. However, potential investors in Golladay need to keep in mind that, in Bevell's 13 years as an offensive coordinator, only twice has one of his receivers topped 120 targets in a season.",

He piled up 395 yards and three TDs in his final four appearances last year, potentially setting the stage for a 2020 breakout. Ryan seems to be on board with the idea, noting that Ridley should benefit from his recent on-field workouts with the veteran quarterback and other teammates. Falcons offensive coordinator Dirk Koetter also expects Ridley to improve in Year 3, mentioning route running as a potential area for continued growth.",

    "report": "Moore is one of the few key holdovers from 2019 for a Panthers team that underwent huge changes in the offseason, ESPN.com's David Newton reports.The new faces include coach Matt Rhule, OC Joe Brady, QB Teddy Bridgewater and WR Robby Anderson, while the crucial departures on offense were TE Greg Olsen, WR Jarius Wright and QBs Kyle Allen and Cam Newton. The switch from Allen to Bridgewater could prove especially fruitful for Moore, who largely made a living on short and intermediate throws during a breakout 2019 campaign. The 23-year-old wideout missed the majority of Week 16 and all of Week 17 due to a concussion, but he previously had been on pace for 98 catches and 1,342 receiving yards. With plenty of time to recover this offseason, Moore should be ready to go whenever the Panthers are able to practice.",

    "report": "Shepard, Golden Tate and Darius Slayton appear locked in as the Giants' top three wide receivers, Michael Eisen of the official team website reports.Each of the three is a viable candidate to lead the team in targets, and the same can probably be said of tight end Evan Engram or even running back Saquon Barkley. Health has arguably become the biggest problem for Shepard, who has played 53 of a possible 64 games in his NFL career but does come with a worrisome history of migraines and concussions. There's also been some question about his effectiveness playing outside rather than the slot, though he seems to draw targets whenever he's on the field, averaging at least 4.1 catches per game in each of his four seasons with the Giants. Given the sturdy competition for targets, a big season from Shepard probably requires QB Daniel Jones taking a sizable step forward in his first year under head coach Joe Judge and OC Jason Garrett.",

He'll receive a $27.5 million signing bonus and take home $42.75 million guaranteed in the new deal, which also includes a no-trade clause. The Cardinals' big financial commitment is a deserved reward for Hopkins, who earned first-team All-Pro honors in each of his final three years with the Texans before being traded in March. While serving as the top target in a Kyler Murray-led Arizona offense that is expected to run one of the NFL's fastest tempos, Hopkins should have a good chance at reaching 1,500 receiving yards for the third time in his career.",

The 30-year-old wideout is a clear favorite to lead the team in targets, albeit in what could be a spread-the-wealth offense featuring three running backs (Marlon Mack, Jonathan Taylor, Nyheim Hines), veteran tight end Jack Doyle and a pair of young wideouts (Parris Campbell, Michael Pittman).",

With an offseason that won't include any preseason action, Sutton's pre-existing chemistry with Drew Lock \"figures to be something (the second-year signal-caller) will lean on heavily at the start of the season.\" Sutton logged a 72/1,112/6 stat line last year, numbers he appears poised to match or exceed, with an improved team context (in terms of QB play and added offensive weapons) in mind.",

    "report": "Head coach Anthony Lynn said Williams (shoulder) is a \"game-time decision\" for Sunday's game versus the Bengals, Gilbert Manzano of The Orange County Register reports.On Saturday, Daniel Popper of The Athletic reported that the Chargers were preparing to play without Williams for most of September, so Lynn's announcement is a clear contradiction. When Williams was first diagnosed with a sprained shoulder on Aug. 25, he was given a 2-to-4 week timeline, and Sunday's game will be nearly three weeks after the injury. His final status will likely depend on how the injury responds during practice this week.",

    "report": "Woods is eager to ink a long-term extension and remain with the Rams, Lindsey Thiry of ESPN reports.The 28-year-old receiver is coming off his second consecutive 1,000-yard campaign and projects to remain a go-to target for quarterback Jared Goff. With Brandin Cooks shipped off to Houston, Woods' role in the passing attack could even expand, and there should also be positive regression ahead of last season's two touchdowns -- Woods had 11 through 28 games over his first two seasons with the Rams. Still, Los Angeles has plenty of weapons, and Woods profiles as more of a possession receiver than big-play threat. As a result, it's probably best to target him as a high-floor asset. Additionally, barring injury, he should prove to be one of the safest mid-round receivers available.",

Still, it's something to keep an eye on ahead of a Sunday night opener (Sept. 13) against the Rams, especially given Cooper's history of playing through lower-body injuries. For what it's worth, Todd Archer of ESPN.com thought Cooper spent a lot of time stretching his quadriceps before he did some resistance-cord workouts with a trainer Thursday morning.",

None of them went to Sanders, but it's only a matter of team before the long-time signal-caller is connecting with his new No. 2 wide receiver. Sanders is somewhat redundant with All-Pro Michael Thomas, though, so it remains to be seen what kind of workload the 33-year-old can earn with his new team. Between the Broncos and 49ers last season, Sanders averaged 5.7 targets per game, which marked his fewest since 2012 as a member of the Steelers.",

    "headlineNews": "Packers' Allen Lazard: Settling in No. 2 WR role",
    "report": "Lazard enters training camp as the No. 2 wide receiver in Green Bay, Matt Schneidman of The Athletic reports.The Packers presumably intended for Lazard to compete with offseason signing Devin Funchess, who is opting out of the 2020 campaign. They could still add another body before Week 1, but the current depth chart shows Lazard competing with the likes of Marquez Valdes-Scantling, Equanimeous St. Brown and Jake Kumerow, i.e., the same group of guys he outclassed last season. It helps that Lazard seems to have the confidence of Aaron Rodgers, who earlier this offseason referred to the 24-year-old wideout as \"an ascending player\" and a great teammate. That said, Lazard isn't exactly a downfield burner, and his solid finish to the 2019 regular season didn't carry over to the playoffs, where he was limited to three catches for 36 yards in two games. Even if he's a regular presence on the field, he won't necessarily see a large number of targets in an offense built around Davante Adams and Aaron Jones.",

The 2017 UDFA has never been much of a fantasy asset, but he did solid work for the Niners as a No. 3 receiver the past two seasons, averaging 7.7 yards on 110 targets while primarily operating from the slot. Bourne could see an uptick in usage early this season if Deebo Samuel is slow to recover from June foot surgery.",

    "report": "Joe Burrow said Sunday that he expects Boyd to have a big 2020 season, Tyler Dragon of The Cincinnati Enquirer reports.\"I have a great connection with [Boyd] right now,\" Burrow said. The 25-year-old wideout demonstrated as much chemistry with his rookie signal-caller during Sunday's scrimmage, per Ben Baby of ESPN.com, when the two connected for a 28-yard touchdown. Burrow made ample use of his slot receiver at LSU in 2019, and Boyd has already proven himself in the form of back-to-back 1,000 yard seasons, so it wouldn't come as much of a shock if the two do indeed develop a lethal connection. With a healthy A.J. Green back in the mix in Cincinnati, however, in addition to John Ross and Tee Higgins, it's unlikely that Boyd will enjoy target volume similar to the 148 looks he saw last season.",

With over three weeks until the season opener, the Browns may still afford Landry the occasional maintenance day, but it appears he'll be ready for Week 1. The 27-year-old is slated to start, and he'll look to build on the career-high 1,174 receiving yards he recorded in 2019.",

    "report": "Fuller spent the offseason working with a trainer who helped him focus on body mechanics, Sarah Barshop of ESPN.com reports.Specifically, the trainer had Fuller fix the way he runs and his posture in an effort to avoid the lower-extremity injuries he's had throughout his career. The wide receiver showed up to camp slight heavier, at 190 pounds, with a \"strong\" lower body, per head coach Bill O'Brien. The ultimate goal is for Fuller to play a full season for the first time in his career. It would be a perfect time for Fuller to play 16 games; he's on the final year of his rookie contract and could demand a high price if he's as productive as he is capable of producing.",

    "report": "Jones (ankle) acknowledged on Twitter that he recently hosted Lions rookie Quintez Cephus and free agent signee Victor Bolden for workouts at his residence.Jones spent the final three games of last season on injured reserve due to an ankle injury. Considering he was seen planting and cutting on both of his ankles in the video he posted, it seems the 30-year-old is getting back to full health. Jones, in a contract year -- along with Kenny Golladay and Danny Amendola -- is also giving the Detroit front office plenty of reason to keep him around -- n spite of his age and contract status -- given his displays of leadership.",

    "report": "Conley has made \"splash\" plays throughout training camp, Gene Frenette of The Florida Times-Union reports.Conley had a solid first season in Jacksonville and did enough for the team to pick up the 2020 option on his contract, but he doesn't appear especially likely to match last year's career highs of 866 snaps, 775 yards and 90 targets. The Jaguars also bring back DJ Chark, Dede Westbrook and Keelan Cole, plus they added Laviska Shenault in the second round of the NFL Draft. While a strong showing this summer likely will allow him to retain a starting job, Conley won't necessarily have an every-down role, nor will he have job security if he fails to produce early on.",

Alexander of The Charlotte Observer reports.Anderson's addition to Carolina's offense bolstered a receiving corps that included D.J. Moore and Curtis Samuel, not to mention tailback Christian McCaffrey. In his first couple practices, Anderson has reportedly been open often due to his agility, a premium component new coordinator Joe Brady and quarterback Teddy Bridgewater will hope to capitalize on. In fact, with a few nice touchdowns in his early camp outings, Anderson already seems to have developed a decent rapport with Bridgewater.",

    "report": "Coach Matt Nagy said Wednesday that Miller \"might have had the best training camp of any player\" on the Bears, Larry Mayer of the Bears' official site reports.Miller apparently got off to a slow start before really finding his groove, with Nagy noting that the young wide receiver was giving \"110 percent\" on each snap by the end of camp. It's at least the second time a Chicago coach has mentioned Miller's improved effort this summer, and the team may be counting on him to be the second option in its passing game after Allen Robinson. The 25-year-old faces some questions that go beyond effort and preparation, as he hasn't done much on the perimeter to his point in his career, picking up the vast majority of his yards from the slot. The inside role works well for three-wideout formations, but Miller could see his ceiling limited if he doesn't also provide something in two-receiver sets.",

He caught only 12 passes in seven games for the Colts and Chargers last year, but a top-three role is a distinct possibility now that the 31-year-old is in Washington, where there appears to be open competition for playing time behind McLaurin. The other candidates for snaps include slot specialist Trey Quinn, rookie fourth-round pick Antonio Gandy-Golden and 2018 UDFA Cam Sims.",

On the other hand, Hopkins draws so much defensive attention that he inevitably will open things up for the likes of Kirk, Fitzgerald and Kenyan Drake. Despite tending to an ankle injury for most of 2019, his second in the NFL, Kirk put up a 68-709-3 line on 108 targets across 13 contests. An improved rapport with Murray and Hopkins' presence could allow Kirk to challenge for the first 1,000-yard campaign of his career.",

Lisfranc surgery last January likely played a role, impacting his offseason routine and even his practice participation throughout the season. Brown seems to have made a quick recovery from follow-up surgery to remove a screw from his foot this past winter, as he was back to running routes at full speed during a May workout with Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson. The reigning MVP and coach John Harbaugh both have made it clear they expect big things from their No. 1 wideout in his second pro season.",

However, Gallup bested Cooper in targets per game (8.1 versus 7.4) last season and was also was one of 16 receivers with at least 1,100 yards and six touchdowns in 2019. Look for the 24-year-old to remain heavily involved in the Cowboys' passing attack, even with the addition of Lamb.",

    "report": "Lockett considered opting out of the 2020 season but decided to play, Joe Fann of NBC Sports Northwest reports.Lockett was diagnosed with a heart abnormality in 2015 while he was going through the draft process, and his cousin reportedly had a serious case of coronavirus. Those two aspects factored into his decision-making process, but ultimately, Lockett relayed that he believes the team has a good safety plan under head coach Pete Carroll's leadership. The 27-year-old Lockett is coming off his best season yet, as he hauled in 82 of 110 targets for 1,057 yards and eight touchdowns, and his targets should be relatively safe despite  DK Metcalf's possible progression.",

Edwards profiles as a prototypical threat on the outside, while Renfrow took most of his snaps out of the slot in 2019. The Raiders initially intended for Ruggs to start in the slot, but in the wake of Tyrell Williams (shoulder) having suffered a season-ending labrum tear, he could instead have an opportunity to move around the field. Ruggs will get a favorable matchup to maximize mismatches with his blazing 4.27 speed during Sunday's season opener in Carolina.",

Alexander of the Charlotte Observer reports.Samuel got off to a hot start during the first week of team activities, but he evidently hasn't flashed since camp first began. Alexander notes that Samuel is dealing with a minor hamstring injury, something which could contribute to his lack of noise in camp even if it doesn't seem to have any chance of impacting his availability for the season opener Sept. 13. Samuel is entering the final year of his rookie contract, and there was speculation that the Panthers could shop him after signing Robby Anderson earlier this offseason. His performance in 2020 will no doubt be pivotal to his future with the team.",

The Patriots list the 22-year-old at 6-foot-4, 225 pounds, though the Arizona State product has indicated that he focused on getting a little less bulky this offseason. In any case, Harry has the size and ability to go up and snatch contested throws, which could result in him doing some red-zone damage this season in the expanded role he's expected to have in New England's offense.",

    "report": "Guyton continues to see first-team reps in practice, Gilbert Manzano of The Orange County Register reports.The injury to Mike Williams (shoulder) essentially assures that Guyton will be a starter for the team's offense at least early on, but that doesn't necessarily mean the speedster will see that many opportunities. Travis Benjamin, who occupied the same projected role Guyton will be in to start 2020, caught just 18 passes over his last 17 games with the Chargers largely acting as a decoy deep threat. The Williams injury might allow for rookies like Joe Reed or K.J. Hill to pick up prominent snaps as the other outside wide receiver, but it's more likely a narrow Chargers passing tree just becomes smaller with an over-reliance on Keenan Allen, Austin Ekeler and Hunter Henry until the big-bodied Williams returns.",

Still, the 22nd overall pick in the 2020 draft could overtake Johnson quickly in the offense to become the No. 2 receiver.

    "headlineNews": "Chiefs' Travis Kelce: Upgrades to full practice",
    "report": "Kelce (knee) was a full participant in Tuesday's practice.After being listed as a limited participant Monday on the Chiefs' first official practice report of the 2020 season, Kelce's ability to take every rep in Tuesday's session erases any concern about his availability for Thursday's game against the Texans. Coming off four straight seasons of at least 80 receptions and 1,000 receiving yards, Kelce profiles as an easy top-two fantasy tight end this season, and his stronger track record on the health front probably makes him a safer choice than 49ers standout George Kittle.",

    "headlineNews": "Ravens' Mark Andrews: Ticketed for more snaps",
    "report": "Andrews projects to see a higher snap count in 2020, writes John Eisenberg of the team's official website.Though Andrews led all tight ends with 10 touchdowns last season, he did so while playing a mere 41 percent of the team's offensive snaps. Part of that was dealing with some bumps and bruises, and part of it was Hayden Hurst commanding a significant chunk of snaps as well. With a clean bill of health and Hurst moving on to Atlanta, the runway is clear for Andrews to play a high percentage of the snaps in Baltimore. Much has been made about the sustainability of his touchdown rate from 2019 (10.2 percent). However, if he sees a major snap count increase and thus major target increase, any regression in touchdown efficiency could be smoothed over by the significant uptick in opportunities.",

    "report": "Engram has looked \"as explosive as ever\" during training camp, according to NJ.com's Art Stapleton.Stapleton isn't the only beat writer to take notice of Engram, with Jordan Raanan of ESPN.com confirming that the tight end was the star of Monday's practice. Coach Joe Judge and teammate Sterling Shepard also provided glowing reviews, all but confirming that Engram has shown no ill effects from the Lisfranc injury that ended his 2019 season. He's averaged at least 4.1 catches and 48.1 yards per game in each of his three pro seasons, but the combination of injuries (14 missed games) and disappointing touchdown production (12 TDs, 27 red-zone targets in 34 games) has kept Engram from a true breakout. The Giants seem to think this will be the year he finally puts it all together.",

He'll have more competition for targets after the Raiders signed Jason Witten and drafted Henry Ruggs and Bryan Edwards, but it's still Waller who has the best odds to lead the team in pass-catching volume. Even if he doesn't quite match the 117 targets he saw during his breakout 2019 campaign, Waller should be a reliable fantasy starter at tight end.",

    "report": "Gronkowski seems to have greatly benefited from taking last season off and has been consistently making plays throughout early padded practices, Scott Smith of the team's official site reports. \"No similarities at all [to 2018 Gronkowski],\" said coach Bruce Arians on Thursday. \"He looks like he was five or six years ago, before all the injuries. The back surgeries have healed, so he's had a year of healing. He looks to me like he was five or six years ago.\"Gronkowski frequently seemed a sluggish shadow of his former self during his last Patriots campaign in 2018, a year when he missed three games and finished with a 47-682-3 line. His elite athleticism helped him get by that season to an extent, but the Buccaneers appear to have acquired an early-career version of Gronk if early camp practices are any indication, with the 10-year pro frequently getting downfield and making catches in traffic with ease. Gronkowski concedes the defense was moving much faster than he remembered during his first couple of practices, but that he now feels \"everything coming back to him day by day.\" The veteran also noted Thursday he's not thinking along the lines of having his snap count limited despite having excellent depth behind him in the form of O.J. Howard and Cameron Brate, noting he'd be willing to be in on every play if necessary but acknowledging his playing time will ultimately be in the hands of the coaching staff.",

    "report": "Henry and the Chargers didn't reach an agreement on a contract extension before Wednesday's deadline, Jeff Miller of the LA Times reports.The 25-year-old tight end will play out 2020 with a base salary of $10.6 million under the franchise tag, potentially facing a second tag for $12.7 million next offseason. Despite missing four games with a knee injury early in the season, Henry finished 2019 with career highs for targets (76), receptions (55) and yards (652). He did slow down in December, when he was limited to a 16-165-2 receiving line in five games. The combination of Tyrod Taylor and Justin Herbert at quarterback isn't ideal, but Henry at least figures to handle a three-down role for the 2020 Chargers, competing for targets with Keenan Allen, Austin Ekeler and Mike Williams.",

Witten saw 83 targets last season as the starter, which would seem to be about Jarwin's ceiling in the offense as the team also tries to work first-round pick CeeDee Lamb into the mix, but the 26-year-old tight end should be a lot more effective on a per-target basis than the aging future Hall of Famer was.",

The 27-year-old may still lose some reps to Vance McDonald, but being a more well-rounded player should keep him on the field more and increase his fantasy potential after recording 31 receptions for 375 yards and three touchdowns last season.",

He was particularly effective down the stretch, racking up 537 yards and seven scores from Weeks 10-17. The veteran tight end is optimistic he can be even better in 2020, adding \"And, you know, hopefully this season will be a lot different, being that me and Drew do have a full season together and more time. So it's just working through those things and (working to) continue to get better.\" The Saints added Emmanuel Sanders in the offseason and drafted Adam Trautman in the third round of this year's draft, but Cook should still be a regular contributor on offense.",

It's not a lock Higbee picks up where he left off, though. To start, it's a small sample, and fourth-year tight end Gerald Everett will also be involved in the passing attack. Still, Higbee is the superior blocker of the two, and he's already showcased his ability to make an impact. A career-best statline this season shouldn't surprise.",

    "report": "Smith is the undisputed top tight end in Tennessee, Jim Wyatt of the team's official website reports.Smith was the top guy after Delanie Walker suffered season-ending injuries the past two years, handling a 75.3 percent snap share in 2018 (13 games) and 70.8 percent share in 2019 (16 games). Smith's impressive work after the catch helped him produce 12.7 yards per reception and 9.4 per target the past two years, but he's never seen consistent volume in the run-first Tennessee offense, averaging only 3.7 targets in the nine games Walker missed last year. While Walker is now out of the picture, the Titans have shown some affinity for using Anthony Firkser over Smith in obvious passing situations, a role that allowed Firkser to average 2.4 targets over the final nine games last year. Smith has the talent to be a high-end fantasy asset in the right role, but it isn't clear if he'll get enough volume to provide steady production in Tennessee this season. He's entering the final year of his rookie contract and will turn 25 in late August.",

Hockenson is working his way back from the ankle injury that ended his rookie season Week 12, and while he's been able to practice with teammates to this point in training camp, it sounds like he's a work in progress. He has four weeks to ramp things up before the Lions are scheduled to face the Bears on Sept. 13.",

GM Ryan Pace quickly clarified that Graham will be the main pass catcher of the two while Kmet gets his NFL footing in a run-blocking role. It won't be a zero-sum game, though, as coach Matt Nagy plans to increase the team's usage of 12 personnel (two tight ends) with Graham playing out of the slot at times. The 33-year-old Graham has a lot to prove this season after falling short of expectations in Green Bay, but he could endure similar inconsistencies with Mitchell Trubisky under center.",

    "report": "Olsen could see the third-most targets in Seattle's passing attack in 2020, Stacy Rost of 710 ESPN Seattle reports.Olsen joined the Seahawks via a one-year, $7 million contract back in February. The 35-year-old looks primed to operate as Seattle's top tight end, as his strongest competition will come from Will Dissly (Achilles), who is recovering from a serious injury sustained last October. Quarterback Russell Wilson has shown an inclination to lean on his tight ends in the passing game, as evidenced by Jacob Hollister finishing as the team's third-leading pass catcher in 2019. As such, it's certainly within the realm of possibility that Olsen could draw more targets than Phillip Dorsett or David Moore, who are the top candidates for the No. 3 receiver job behind Tyler Lockett and DK Metcalf. Of course, Dissly, Hollister, Colby Parkinson (foot) and Luke Willson could all factor into the mix at tight end, with any combination of those player potentially combining for enough snaps to siphon away targets from Olsen.",

But, with a year of development, Fant should have every opportunity to be the second major threat in the passing game behind Courtland Sutton. Fant finished second on the team in receiving yards (562), targets (66) and touchdowns (three) as a rookie. However, he faded down the stretch and -- despite a monster 113-yard performance against Houston in Week 14 -- saw his targets per game drop sharply once Lock entered the fold Week 13 (4.7 versus 2.8). Shurmur has experience with athletic tight ends from his time with Evan Engram in New York, and with improved chemistry with Lock, there's reason to be optimistic about Fant's sophomore campaign.",

Top tight end Zach Ertz (upper body) also retook the practice field Sunday, putting Goedert back in position to handle his usual amount of daily reps. Even if Goedert's thumb isn't fully healed by Week 1, the expectation appears to be that he'll play through any issues.",

The third-year pro was listed as the No. 2 tight end behind Durham Smythe on Miami's first unofficial depth chart, per Wolfe, but Joe Schad of The Palm Beach Post notes that Gesicki nonetheless remains locked in to the majority of receiving work at the position. Gesicki put together a late-season breakout in 2019 and concluded the campaign with 51 catches for 570 yards and five touchdowns, while Smythe has never managed 100 receiving yards in a single season. As such, Smythe's position atop the depth chart primarily seems like a hint that he could be in line for a heavy blocking workload Week 1.",

The 30-year-old will be a backup for the first time since his rookie season, but the reduced role could help keep the veteran away from the medical tent. George Kittle is the clear top dog among the four tight ends on the roster, but head coach Kyle Shanahan has shown a proclivity for two tight-end sets in the past. Reed's elite route running and hands -- along with his mediocre blocking -- could also result in the him lining up in slot or out wide more often, especially with the 49ers' receiver corps looking questionable heading into Week 1. Reed could join the likes of Dallas Goedert and O.J. Howard as backup tight ends with some fantasy upside this season.",

Buried behind Mark Andrews on the depth chart in Baltimore, Hurst only recorded 43 catches across 28 appearances. General manager Thomas Dimitroff did, however, invest a second-round draft choice to acquire Hurst, indicating that the Falcons remain fond of his potential.",

    "report": "Offensive coordinator Brian Daboll has been impressed with how Knox and tight ends coach Rob Boras have worked together so far in training camp.\n\"Dawson has done a really good job,\" Daboll told Maddy Glab of the Bills' official site this week. So Rob [Boras] does a good job meeting extra with them. He's a young player still, really young. Hopefully we get more out of him this year. I know he's working hard to do that.\"Knox will be competing with veteran Tyler Kroft for looks in the Buffalo offense. Knox, a second-year player, has the better athletic skills and more upside, so we'll see if he can keep chugging along the learning curve and take the top job to himself instead of having to share it with Kroft.",

    "report": "Graham is one of the Falcons' top two pass-catching tight ends, Vaughn McClure of ESPN.com reports.The 24-year-old seems primed to secure a roster spot with Atlanta for a second straight season, after recording nine catches for 149 yards and one touchdown across 16 games in 2019. He made his greatest impact while Austin Hooper sat out Weeks 11 through 13 with a knee injury, corralling seven passes for 117 yards and his lone TD during that stretch. Matthew Tabeek of the Falcons' official site considers Graham a lock to make the 53-man roster alongside starter Hayden Hurst, while Luke Stocker and rookie Jared Pinkney continue to battle for depth roles.",

Despite seeing ample playing time last season, McDonald caught only 38 of 55 targets for 273 yards and three touchdowns, though the quarterback situation following Ben Roethlisberger's injury certainly played a part in the poor production. Regardless, McDonald's opportunities could become more sporadic if he doesn't separate himself in camp.",

    "report": "The Rams received multiple calls inquiring about the availability of Everett, but the team declined to entertain them, Jourdan Rodrigue of The Athletic reports.Everett is in the final year of his rookie contract, and while it's probably safe to say his tenure with the Rams has been a disappointment since being selected in the second round of the 2017 NFL Draft, there have been plenty of promising signs from the athletic tight end. Everett has flashed big-play potential in limited playing time over the past three years with 14 receptions going for more than 20 yards and seven touchdowns on only 142 targets. Additionally, the Rams are expected to utilize more two-TE formations, and there are enough weapons in the Los Angeles offense to create mismatches to capitalize on. Everett shouldn't be written off just yet, and while he could be a frustrating player to rely on week-in, week-out, expect a number of solid showings throughout the year. In particular, he could prove to be a solid low-priced target for DFS players and/or a streaming option in season-long formats.",

He won't necessarily have a three-down role, but the 29-year-old does figure to see more targets than Jeremy Sprinkle and Marcus Baugh, potentially setting up a rare late-20s breakout. It wouldn't necessarily be the type of breakout that leads to mainstream fantasy value, but Thomas does have a good chance to set career highs in every major receiving category.",

Sprinkle had only 26 catches on 600 offensive snaps last year, starting 13 of 16 games for an injury-riddled Washington squad.",

The 26-year-old is the favorite to serve as Arizona's official starting tight end, although he only racked up 15 catches for 202 yards and a touchdown last season. As evidenced by this news, expect Williams to be ready for Week 1 of the regular season barring an injury setback.",

    "report": "Arnold has been the Cardinals' top receiving tight end during training camp, Kyle Odegard of the team's official site reports.During his time in New Orleans, the undrafted wide receiver spent his rookie season in 2017 on injured reserve before switching to tight end during the 2018 offseason. That said, he recorded just 14 catches in 12 games with the Saints before they waived him last December. The Cardinals scooped Arnold up, and he struck up an instant rapport with Kyler Murray, corralling six of 10 targets for 102 yards and two touchdowns in three contests. Arnold doesn't have much competition for targets in his position group, and No. 1 TE Maxx Williams currently is tending to an undisclosed issue, which raises Arnold's profile further in Arizona's ascending offense.",

Eifert appeared in all 16 games and caught 43 of 63 targets for 436 yards and three touchdowns in 2019 with the Bengals, but he's unlikely to replicate those numbers in 2020 without moving up the depth chart.",

    "report": "Tonyan likely will start the season as Green Bay's top receiving threat at tight end, Matt Schneidman of The Athletic reports.The role widely was viewed as Jace Sternberger's to lose, and the 2019 third-round pick may have indeed fallen behind in the competition. The 26-year-old Tonyan will likely be part of a rotation at the position, with Sternberger, Josiah Deguara and Marcedes Lewis also in the mix to earn roles. Tonyan has 14 catches in 27 regular-season games for the Packers, so there hasn't been much hint of fantasy upside during his career.",

Given the Buccaneers arguably boast the deepest tight-end room in the league, it's unsurprising they list a 12 alignment as their base offense for depth-chart purposes. While Smith notes Cameron Brate and even blocking specialist Antony Auclair could be in on the first offensive play at times this season depending on specific packages, Howard seems like a good bet to see the second-most targets, at minimum, at the position.",

    "headlineNews": "Patriots' Devin Asiasi: Returns to limited practice",
    "report": "Asiasi (foot/ankle) was able to practice in a limited fashion Wednesday, Phil Perry of NBC Sports Boston reports.Asiasi was forced out of Tuesday's practice after appearing to suffer a foot or ankle injury, but his presence on the field Wednesday indicates that the issue was minor. He and fellow 2020 third-round tight end Dalton Keene are looking to carve out roles in the New England offense as rookies, with Darren Hartwell of NBC Sports Boston noting that Asiasi had \"been plenty solid in the first week of workouts\" prior to his exit from Tuesday's practice. For his part, Keene has shown well in practice as well, and it's plausible that the duo will work in a timeshare out of the gate. In such a scenario, both players would be hit-or-miss fantasy options, though if either quickly emerges in the Patriots' passing game, there could be some in-season value to be found.",
