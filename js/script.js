Their offense was buzzing in the first half, as it scored on all but one drive to take a 24-0 lead into halftime. Wilson was responsible for two of those touchdowns, as he found D.K. Metcalf in the end zone twice for scores of four and two yards. Things died down for the Seahawks in the second half, but they afforded themselves enough of a cushion to hold on. Wilson got back on track with elite efficiency, posting a 70.0 completion percentage and 9.1 YPA. He'll look to keep it up against the Buccaneers' weak secondary in Week 9.",

    "analysis": "The final line is a mixed bag from a fantasy perspective, but Winston was downright bad at times Sunday in a real-world football sense and was guilty of an inexcusable four turnovers. The mistake-prone quarterback did have the connection with Mike Evans in top form, as he hit his trusted wideout for 11 completions, 198 yards and a pair of touchdowns from nine and two yards out, respectively. Winston's second pick was particularly ill-timed, as it came at the Titans' 25-yard line with 26 seconds remaining, effectively sealing the Buccaneers' fate. Coach Bruce Arians had emphasized heading into the bye week that he hadn't considered benching Winston, but a second straight multi-interception effort and third consecutive game with sub-55.0-percent passing might lead to a reevaluation of that statement. Winston's next opportunity to right the ship comes Week 9 against the Seahawks.",

    "analysis": "Minshew tossed a pair of touchdowns in the first quarter, finding Keelan Cole from six yards out and later connecting with Chris Conley on a 70-yarder. He added a fourth-quarter dagger to D.J. Chark, converting on third-and-goal from the eight-yard line to give his team a two-touchdown lead with 4:13 remaining. Minshew's first career three-touchdown performance gives him an impressive 13:2 touchdown to interception ratio heading into a Week 9 meeting with the Texans.",

Brissett had probably his worst statistical game of the season Sunday against a very tough Denver pass defense, but he still found a way to make it work. Brissett has scored multiple times in five of seven games and has done well protecting the ball.  Indianapolis still typically leans heaviest on its running game and defense, but Brissett has developed as an impressive maestro when needed.

Garoppolo may need to take better care of the ball at some point, having been picked off in six of seven games this season, but he'll likely find himself in a caretaker role again next week against the Cardinals.",

As a result, both drives ended in field-goal attempts. Still, the entire offense predictably struggled to generate any sort of consistent yardage against a stout Bears' defense, particularly the running game, which was held to just three yards per carry on 12 attempts. Turnovers continue to be an issue for Rivers, who has coughed up the ball nine times through eight games. However, considering he'll likely be near the top of the NFL in  pass attempts by the conclusion of Week 8, the sheer amount of opportunities he sees makes him a serviceable fantasy option most weeks.",

    "report": "Rodgers (knee) completed 23 of 33 pass attempts for 305 yards and three touchdowns while adding 29 rushing yards on six carries in a 31-24 win over Kansas City on Sunday.",
    "analysis": "Rodgers picked apart a subpar Chiefs defense with ease, focusing his attention on passes to his running backs that were matched up up with linebackers. The former MVP has looked like his prime self over the past two weeks, racking up over 750 yards and nine total touchdowns over that span. Rodgers will take on the Chargers in Week 9, and the key matchup will be San Diego's elite edge rushers versus Green Bay's top-tier offensive tackles. The star quarterback may see his production come back down to earth if coach Matt LaFleur decides to attack the Chargers on the ground (117.1 yards allowed per game), where they have been far more vulnerable in comparison to the pass (216.1 yards allowed per game).",

Matt Moore will step in as the starting quarterback Week 8 and is likely to garner the nod again Week 9, though that could change if Mahomes continues to bounce back from the injury far quicker than anticipated.",

Over his last two starts, Fitzpatrick has compiled a meager 3:3 TD:INT and has fumbled four times, losing one of them. The veteran is set for a favorable matchup in Week 9, putting him under consideration in leagues that start two quarterbacks or utilize a QB flex spot. Even if Fitzpatrick shows improved form in his outings to come, it wouldn't be a surprise if the winless Dolphins eventually turn back to second-year signal-caller Josh Rosen later in the season.",

Obviously, Trubisky hasn't been a solid fantasy option this year, as he's thrown touchdown passes in just two games while his rushing yardage has mostly evaporated from what he produced in 2018. Should he eventually lose the starting job, Chase Daniel would be a slight upgrade for fantasy owners. For now, Trubisky's downside makes him a risky player to trust in fantasy lineups.",

Bell ranks second among all backs with 91 percent snap share, and a Week 9 matchup with the Dolphins should at least provide temporary relief. Miami has given up the fourth-most fantasy points to running backs under standard scoring, yielding 4.9 yards per carry and 7.7 yards per target to the position, along with nine touchdowns in seven games.",

The 24-year-old has been putting up RB1 numbers through six games (602 yards and six touchdowns), but we could see an uptick in production after the team's Week 8 bye now that Dallas' offensive line is the healthiest it has been all year.",

    "analysis": "Jones had to leave the contest with a shoulder injury at the tail end of the first half, but he was able to return after halftime and went on to post one of the better receiving lines from a running back we've seen this season. The 24-year-old did most of his damage on a pair of wheel routes out of the backfield where he and Aaron Rodgers exposed man coverage on a lone linebacker.  Jones has made significant strides as a receiver this season, nearly doubling his aerial output from last season in four fewer games. The third-year back has seen his rushing production take a hit, averaging 4.1 yards per carry after gaining notice in fantasy circles with a 5.5 average over his first two seasons. Jones remains the preferred back in Green Bay over Jamaal Williams, and heads into a soft matchup against the Chargers next Sunday.",

His pass-catching upside remains low with zero touchdowns and 53 total receiving yards since Week 1, but his 18.9 carries-per-game average and six total touchdowns keep him a viable running back option. In Week 9, Henry and the Titans' ground attack will be going up against a Panthers defense that only allowed one rusher to exceed 70 yards against them between Weeks 4 and 7.",

The Broncos were forced to punt and watch a game-ending opposing field goal for the third time this season. Lindsay echoed quarterback Joe Flacco after the game that he wished the offense was a little more aggressive. The point is fair, but Denver has also struggled to find any sort of rhythm regardless of situation. Lindsay has been a rare bright spot, with at least 75 total yards in four of his last six games and four touchdowns. Something to watch in the coming weeks will be Lindsay's role in the passing game with Emmanuel Sanders now in San Francisco. Lindsay's five catches Sunday were a season high.",

    "analysis": "In a fifth straight game with 20 or more carries, Carson produced well with 4.5 YPC, although he failed to haul in his only target. It's a positive sign that he still managed to be a workhorse despite Rashaad Penny finally coming to life by turning eight carries into 55 yards (6.9 YPC). Now that Penny's healthy, Carson will need to stay on top of his game to avoid losing touches, but his fantasy value should be safe as long as he's producing like this. Carson will look to keep it going in Week 9 against the Buccaneers.",

The team still racked up 199 rushing yards to the tune of 5.7 yards per carry, but that was mostly due to a big effort on the ground from Lamar Jackson and a helpful performance from Gus Edwards. Ingram's efficiency has waned in recent weeks, as he's averaging 47.3 rushing yards on 14.7 carries over the last three games. He'll face another tough matchup next Sunday night against the Patriots.",

Sanders actually had a 65-yard touchdown run himself but left in the third quarter due to a shoulder injury. Howard also watched third-stringer Boston Scott vulture a four-yard score in the third, but the lead back then found the end zone from three yards out himself in the fourth. The former Bears workhorse has five rushing touchdowns in his last six games, and Howard could be in for a larger workload against his former Bears teammates in Week 9 if Sanders is forced to miss additional time.",

    "analysis": "Peterson shook off the ankle issues he'd been saddled with earlier in the week to make a successful return to the city where he enjoyed the most prolific seasons of his career. With a 29-yard scamper in the third quarter, Peterson passed LaDainian Tomlinson for sixth place on the NFL's all-time rushing list after overtaking Jerome Bettis earlier in the game. Peterson has been a beneficiary of Washington's change at head coach, as interim boss Bill Callahan has afforded him 57 carries over three games since replacing Jay Gruden. The future Hall of Famer will look to eclipse the 75-yard mark for the fourth consecutive contest at the expense of the Bills in a Week 9 interconference matchup a week from Sunday.",

Still, this was arguably the 26-year-old's best game since the aforementioned return, as he showed off his trademark elusiveness on a 19-yard touchdown scamper in which he changed direction on a nifty backdoor cut to find space. With the Chargers' offensive line in shambles, it's hard to have any sort of confidence in Gordon returning to last year's form, one that saw him average 5.1 yards per carry. However, he's a capable red-zone threat in an offense that has been able to move the ball despite difficult matchups such as Sunday's.",

During Sunday's win over the Bills, the rookie running back reportedly aggravated a shoulder injury that dates back to his time at Penn State. While it's certainly good news that the 22-year-old has avoided a significant injury, the Eagles could take a cautious approach with him ahead of a Week 10 bye. If Sanders ends up sitting against the Bears, Darren Sproles (quadriceps) -- if cleared to play -- and Boston Scott would be candidates for change-of-pace roles behind Jordan Howard.",

Week 9's opponent, San Diego, is giving up 117.1 rushing yards per game, so there could be a large enough piece of the pie for Williams to carve out flex value in deeper formats, especially if star wideout Davante Adams (toe) is forced to miss another contest.",

    "report": "Cohen rushed four times for nine yards and caught three passes for 37 yards in Chicago's 17-16 loss to the Chargers on Sunday.",
    "analysis": "With this game being close throughout, the Bears were able to commit to David Montgomery as the primary running back, which kept Cohen from seeing more than three targets. He did most of his damage when lined up as a slot receiver, catching a 31-yard pass down the seam to move the offense into scoring position. He's yet to rush for 20 yards in a game this season and has reached 40 receiving yards just once, and aside from averaging six receptions per contest, he's been a low-upside fantasy option in 2019.",

    "report": "Lewis caught his lone target for a two-yard gain during Sunday's 27-23 win over Tampa Bay.",
    "analysis": "Lewis has now amassed just four total yards over the past two weeks and has yet to score or tally more than 30 yards in a game this season. It's not as if Lewis is being replaced as the Titans' No. 2 RB, it's just that Derrick Henry has hogged touches this season. With Marcus Mariota now on the bench and Ryan Tannehill under center, the Titans seem to have opted to throw it more, but even then Lewis has been tasked with picking up blitzes rather than running routes. Sunday's opponents, the Panthers, have been gashed on the ground this season to the tune of 5.0 yards per carry, but it's hard to see Lewis getting enough touches to take advantage.",

The rookie has eclipsed 60 rushing yards in two of his last three games, and although his week-to-week opportunities are far from consistent, Mattison has a good chance of seeing a solid amount of carries in any game where Minnesota has a secure second-half lead, given head coach Mike Zimmer's preference for the ground attack. Mattison will look to put together another strong effort in a Week 9 matchup against the Chiefs a week from Sunday.",

Samuels, who didn't play two days earlier in the Steelers' win over Miami, has been giving a clean bill of health following his recovery from a knee scope. He could end up having a prominent role in the Steelers' Week 9 attack, especially given the current statuses of the other backs on the roster.",

Booker's silence offensively came during a game in which Royce Freeman reportedly battled shoulder discomfort, and head coach Vic Fangio told reporters that Green Bay dared the Broncos to run. If he wasn't used in such a game against Green Bay, it's doubtful that he gets many opportunities against the Jaguars.",

Dallas was in control of the contest from start to finish, so the 25-year-old had to make due with just five targets (tied for the lowest mark in a full game this season). Cooper maximized those targets, reaching the century mark for the third time this season. The star wideout's fantasy owners were not only rewarded with an unlikely start and strong stat line, but the Cowboys' upcoming bye week will give the receiver plenty of time to fully heal up before a soft matchup against the Giants on Monday Night Football in Week 9.",

His touchdown came on an impressive catch of an underthrown pass off the top of the defensive back's helmet to give Pittsburgh its first lead of the game. Smith-Schuster entered the contest averaging less than 57 yards per game but has now scored twice in his last three games. He faces a difficult challenge in Week 9 against an Indianapolis defense that has not allowed opposing wide receivers to catch more than one touchdown in a game this season.",

    "analysis": "Unlike fellow Panthers wideout Curtis Samuel, Moore had proven to be a high-floor option through the first seven weeks of the regular season by compiling six-plus catches and more than 70 receiving yards in four of his first six outings to kick off the year. Against a San Francisco defense that entered the contest ranked No. 1 in the NFL with 133.5 passing yards allowed per game, however, the second-year receiver struggled to get much going, as the Panthers were held under 30 points for just the second time in the team's past five outings. Upcoming in Week 9 is a matchup against a Titans defense that allowed Mike Evans to rack up 11 catches for 198 yards and two touchdowns, but otherwise did not permit a Buccaneers player to score or exceed 45 receiving yards Sunday.",

    "analysis": "Sutton came up big midway through the second quarter, catching a pass over the middle and stiff-arming his way for a 33-yard gain to set up a Denver field goal. Sutton looked comfortable in the undisputed WR1 role and Joe Flacco lamented after the game that the Broncos didn't give their sophomore target enough opportunities down the stretch. Denver's offense has been putrid this season, but Sutton has been a bright spot while averaging 16.3 yards per reception and recording a team-high three scores. Next up is a struggling Browns defense team that has been so-so in keeping opposing receivers in front of them this season.",

    "analysis": "Watkins' stay on the sideline lasted the better part of three games, but the Chiefs' receiving corps is now firing on all cylinders. All that awaits them is the return of quarterback Patrick Mahomes, which could come as soon as next Sunday versus the Vikings. Watkins has turned in mediocre outings across the board since his Week 1 explosion, but perhaps having all of the team's offensive weapons back will benefit him. Watkins logged 86 percent of the offensive snaps Sunday, compared to 92-plus percent in each of the first four games, so he may see additional run in his second game back from injury next week.",

Of course, with a Week 10 bye coming up, the Eagles could realistically take a cautious approach to Jackson's recovery and target the Nov. 17 game against the Patriots for his return.",

Even if Shepard upgrades to full participation, he'll still need to receive clearance from an independent neurologist later this week in order to play in games, per Jordan Raanan of ESPN.com.

It is no secret that Pettis has been a colossal disappointment in his sophomore season. From having his motivation questioned by his head coach in the preseason, to poor statistical results despite technically being a starter (10 catches for 88 yards and a touchdown over seven games), there isn't a positive takeaway from his 2019 campaign so far. In fact, following the acquisition of Emmanuel Sanders earlier this week, there was a report that Pettis could be dealt before Tuesday's trade deadline, according to NFL Insider Adam Caplan. A trade to a more pass-happy offense could be the recipe he needs to tap back into the potential the 2018 second-round pick displayed last season, but if he sticks in San Francisco, Pettis will not carry much fantasy value heading into Thursday's matchup against the Cardinals.",

However, Titans defensive back Logan Ryan seemed to run Perriman's route ahead of him and picked the pass off. After the game, head coach Bruce Arians blamed Winstons' two INTs on the receivers, including Perriman. The fourth-year player has been incredibly inefficient this season with just three catches for 16 yards on 16 targets. Sunday brings a Seahawks team that has surrendered plenty of passing yards this season, but expect them to be accumulated by the likes of Chris Godwin and Mike Evans instead.",

    "analysis": "Samuel had a quiet day as a receiver, but he was able to do some damage as a runner. Coach Kyle Shanahan dialed up the same jet sweep play for his rookie wideout on both carries, and Samuel cut his second attempt back inside and hit paydirt for the second time in six games. Usual starter Marquise Goodwin missed Sunday's contest for personal reasons, so new acquisition Emmanuel Sanders took his spot in the starting lineup, but it was Samuel -- and not Dante Pettis -- who started opposite the veteran. The latter had started every game he has been healthy for up until this point, so this could signal a change in the depth chart moving forward. It will be interesting to see who ends up starting alongside Sanders against the Cardinals on Thursday (assuming Goodwin is available), but it appears that Samuel will occupy one of the three primary WR slots.",

Davis' first start alongside Ryan Tannehill in Week 7 was extremely encouraging, as he racked up six catches for 80 yards and a touchdown, but in Week 8 he was contained to fewer than 40 receiving yards for the third time in his past four outings. Upcoming next is a matchup against a Panthers team that entered the weekend as one of the NFL's eight best pass defenses with just 225 yards allowed per game through the air.",

    "analysis": "Kenny Golladay stole the show with a pair of touchdown catches, but Amendola was crucial in helping Detroit sustain drives - just like he was last week against the Vikings. In fact, Amendola has now been the target of almost a quarter of Matthew Stafford's pass attempts over the past two games. While fantasy owners should still keep in mind that Amendola seems to have a low floor in this offense -- he caught just five of seven targets for 43 yards in three games from Week 2 through Week 6 -- it's possible the chest injury that forced him to miss one of those games played a role in that lowly output. In any case, it's clear that Stafford is becoming rather fond of the veteran wideout, and there's plenty of reason to believe the pair could have another productive outing Week 9 against the Raiders.",

The 25-year-old was coming off of a huge 133-yard performance, so Sunday's dud will leave a sour taste in fantasy owners' mouths. Valdes-Scantling was expected to take over top receiving duties while Davante Adams (toe) remains sidelined, but the wideout is averaging just 1.5 receptions and 2.8 targets in four games as a starter. It is unclear whether Adams will be able to return for Sunday's matchup against the Chargers, but even if he doesn't, expectations for MVS should be kept in check against a defense that is more susceptible to the run (21st-ranked defense) as opposed to the pass (5th).",

However, he's cleared 40 yards receiving in just one game thus far this season, as he's partly fallen victim to a combination of inconsistent quarterback play and a renewed focus on the ground attack since Bill Callahan took over as head coach three games ago. Richardson will look to build on Thursday's effort when he faces the Bills in a Week 9 interconference battle a week from Sunday.",

It didn't work out that way as Hamilton was held catchless for the third time this season and was even edged out in offensive snaps by Fred Brown, 46 to 45. The Broncos seem as though they will fill the void Sanders left behind by throwing it more to Courtland Sutton and the backs and tight ends, namely rookie Noah Fant. That would place Hamilton as no better than third or fourth in the pecking order in an offense that has looked horrid and will give Brandon Allen the first start of his career Sunday against Cleveland.",

He recorded just one catch last week in a favorable matchup against Arizona, so although he was held under 55 receiving yards for the fourth straight game, this was a much more useful effort from the tight end. Engram could be utilized often next Monday against a Cowboys team he torched in the opening game of the season.",

There's a chance that Patrick Mahomes (knee) could return for Week 9's matchup with the Vikings, a team that has been average against tight ends this year, ranking 14th for fantasy points allowed to opponents at the position.",

He's blipped on the radar a couple of times this season, most recently catching three passes on six targets with a 31-yard touchdown in Week 6. He also had an 82-yard game with a score in Week 4's romp over the Ravens. The Browns don't have a tight end in the top 50 in receptions, but a Cleveland tight end has accounted for five of quarterback Baker Mayfield's six touchdowns. At some point, David Njoku (wrist) could return to dominate the position, but that won't happen until Week 12 at the earliest.",

    "analysis": "It was another game where Houston's tight ends were integral to the passing offense. Akins and Darren Fells combined for 11 targets, tying the position's season high, but it was Fells that made the most impact by catching two red-zone touchdowns. For this one game, the Texans partially made up for the absence of Will Fuller (hamstring) by allocating more opportunities to their tight ends, while Keke Coutee did not even get off the sideline. Halfway through the season, Akins has already matched his catch and target totals from all of 2018. Unfortunately, he evenly shares the position with Fells, and fantasy owners are rolling the dice any given week when selecting either one.",

Kroft was on the field for 58 percent of the offensive plays, while rookie Dawson Knox saw 45 percent, blocker Lee Smith 32 percent, and Tommy Sweeney was inactive. Kroft didn't get a single target in his first game of the season last week, so the modest Week 8 production represents improved involvement in the offense. Still, this isn't an effective passing team and Kroft has to share looks with too many others to offer consistent value.",

    "analysis": "A question heading into Sunday was which Bronco would benefit from Emmanuel Sanders' trade to San Francisco. The early indications are positive for Fant, who set season highs in catches and targets, albeit with measly yardage. Despite his unique size-speed combination, Fant is only averaging 9.8 yards per reception and has been a relative non-factor in the red zone with his only touchdown of the season coming on a 25-yard screen play in Week 4. The results may not improve much, but expect Fant to get WR2-level targets down the stretch on a Denver team without many options at receiver.",

For all the accolades the former Penn State product earned as an athletic specimen ahead of the 2018 draft, he's struggled to establish himself on a team that isn't exactly full of top-notch weapons. Though Gesicki's a good red-zone target in theory, just two of his 25 targets this season have come inside the 20. Don't expect much of a change Sunday, even against a struggling Jets squad.",
