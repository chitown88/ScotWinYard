The Ravens offense was very inconsistent, partially because of Jackson's iffy accuracy and partially because of Baltimore's bottom-five receiver depth chart. Jackson's 7.3 yards per attempt average is enough for this offense to be potent through the air if Baltimore can bring in another pass-catcher this offseason. As a rusher, Jackson remains in a tier of his own. He had 1,005 rushing yards and seven scores on 159 carries (6.3 YPC). Jackson needs more around him for the Ravens to reach the Super Bowl, but he's a locked-in top-five fantasy quarterback regardless. The Ravens will be picking up his fifth-year option this offseason. Hopefully they give Allen Robinson a phone call, too.\n",

He also moved past Brett Favre for the most career postseason passing yards in franchise\u00a0history. Although Rodgers'\u00a0one-yard scramble in the first half gave the Packers an early two-score lead, his most impressive play was a 58-yard strike down the field to Allen Lazard (4/96/1) to ice the game with 2:54 remaining in the final quarter. It was also the second time a Rodgers-led offense posted 30-plus points on the league's No. 1 scoring defense in the postseason. Green Bay will host whomever wins between the Buccaneers and Saints in the Conference Championship.\n",

    "analysis": "Although he closed the year with a gutsy performance (and surgically-repaired thumb) at Lambeau Field, Goff's 3,952 passing yards in 2020 would've fallen well short of the 4,600 he tossed in both of his last two campaigns\u00a0even if he was available for the team's Week 17 game against the Cardinals. His final box score will show a career-high 67% completion rate across 15 starts, but the 26-year-old still struggled immensely under pressure and cowardly finished ahead of only Alex Smith (3.8), Jimmy Garoppolo (3.9), and Drew Brees (6.3) in air yards per attempt (6.5). Unfortunately for the Rams, Goff's $34.6 million cap hit in 2021 \u2014 fifth-highest among all players next year \u2014 ensures he'll be back under McVay for at least one more run.\n",

Pittsburgh made it interesting in the third quarter, scoring 13 unanswered to close the gap to a 35-23 deficit, but coach Mike Tomlin cowardly punted the ball back to Cleveland on 4th-and-6 to start\u00a0the fourth quarter and could only watch as Nick Chubb housed a 40-yard touchdown pass from Mayfield on the Browns' sixth play of the possession. Cleveland's injury-riddled o-line also kept Mayfield clean without a single pressure permitted throughout the game. The Browns will take the night to celebrate this one before returning in the Divisional Round against the Chiefs.\n",

Although Jones' box score (and tape) shows explosiveness at first glance, he still discouragingly handled just 15-of-33 backfield touches and matched Jamaal Williams in carries inside the 10-yard line with four each. Given the team's surprising usage of multiple backs, Jones will be a tough pill to swallow for any two-game DFS slates in the Conference Championship round.\n",

Chubb's 22 touches were\u00a0his most since Week 12, out-carrying Kareem Hunt 18-8.

    "headlineNews": "J.K. Dobbins rushed 10 times for 42 yards in the Ravens' Division Round loss to the Bills.\n",
    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Dobbins was never able to break out of the Ravens' running back by committee despite averaging 6.0 yards per carry. He reached 100 rushing yards just twice and only averaged 12.1 carries in the nine games after the bye. The Ravens are likely to part ways with Mark Ingram this offseason, so Dobbins' 2021 box scores should be improved even if Gus Edwards hangs around as a restricted free agent. Lamar Jackson's lack of history targeting running backs and Dobbins' questionable hands (18 receptions) leave his fantasy ceiling tied to rushing production (805-9\u00a0on 134 carries). That's fine in standard scoring. Less than ideal in PPR. Dobbins will project for 1,000 or more yards in 2021 as the Ravens' 1A in a potential two-back committee.\n",

Edwards will max out as a fantasy\u00a0RB4\u00a0if the Baltimore backfield is Edwards and J.K. Dobbins in 2021 because he's not a receiving threat (9 receptions).

Adams' longest gain\u00a0was a 21-yard catch on the ensuing play after Jared Goff hit rookie Van Jefferson for a four-yard score.

    "analysis": "Woods again led the Rams in targets (129) and air yards (1,169) in 2020, matching a career-high in touchdown receptions (6) while rushing for 150-plus yards for the second time in the last three years. He\u2019s quietly accrued at least 129 targets in every season since 2018, suiting up for 47 of a possible 48 regular season games in that span. Although Woods has consistently averaged a 23% target share from Jared Goff the past three years, it\u2019s possible the former sees a slight uptick in volume for the 2021 season since Josh Reynolds is likely to land elsewhere in free agency. Woods will inevitably be tied to the hip with Cooper Kupp in offseason rankings, but it\u2019s Woods who remains the more valuable option between the two in a vacuum moving forward.\n",

    "headlineNews": "Marquise Brown caught 4-of-7 targets for 87 yards in the Ravens' Division Round loss to the Bills.\n",
    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Brown was unusable for the first half of the 2020 season in fantasy circles, but he caught fire down the stretch to somewhat save his end-of-year stat line (58-769-8 on 100 targets). The second-year pro was utilized downfield even more this season, which partially explains his streaky production. It's worth questioning if Brown profiles as an NFL team's No. 1 receiver. At the very least, the Ravens need to bring in a capable No. 2 receiver this offseason to ease Brown's individual matchups. Nonetheless, his elite speed will keep his fantasy hopes alive as a flex option.\u00a0He's averaged 45.1 yards per game through two seasons.\n",

The writing was on the wall\u00a0the moment the organization pulled the trigger on Van Jefferson in the second round, but Reynolds still logged a career-high 802 snaps (72%) for an offense that called the league's sixth-most pass plays from 11 personnel. Given his age and experience under coach Sean McVay, Reynolds will likely garner a significant contract as a starter in free agency.\n",

Across 14 games, he turned 88 targets into 58 receptions for 701 yards and eight touchdowns, enough production to hang around the top-five tight end rankings for the entire campaign. Lamar Jackson's inconsistent\u00a0accuracy and dominant rushing\u00a0make\u00a0Andrews a volatile fantasy asset on a week-to-week basis even though he is\u00a0the Ravens' No. 1 or No. 2 passing-game target. Andrews, 25,\u00a0belongs in the second tier of positional rankings heading into summer fantasy drafts. The 2021 season will be a contract year for Andrews.\n",

He finished 22nd-overall in fantasy points per game (8.5) among tight ends, scoring three of his five touchdowns while matched up against Philadelphia's warm bodies at linebacker in Week 2.
