    "analysis": "Brady's lone interception came on a pass that Scott Miller had in his hands and coughed up to a waiting defender. If it weren't for that mistake on Miller's part, this might have been a perfect day for Brady. He routinely picked apart the Falcons secondary on deep plays including three scores from 25 or more yards out. The biggest concern for the Brady and the Bucs will be Mike Evans' health. Evans was ruled out shortly after going down with a knee injury in the first half. Luckily for Brady, he cleared found a rhythm with Chris Godwin and Antonio Brown, both of whom topped 100 yards and found the end zone. Brady will face off against the winner of the NFC East which will either the Giants or Washington depending on what happens in Washington's Sunday night game.\n",

He attempted 54 deep shots on the season, the 16th most in the league. Deshaun Watson had the second best adjusted completion rate on downfield passes. Mayfield's success on deep passes brought a much-needed element to the Cleveland offense, which began the season as a conservative, run-heavy unit seemingly uninterested in big plays. Nearly 13 percent of Mayfield's throws beyond 20 yards over the season's final six weeks compared to a 10 percent deep throw rate in the season's first six weeks. Mayfield will have to remain aggressive if the Browns are going to upset Pittsburgh in the Wild Card round.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "The Bills are a pass-first team, and Singletary surpassed 14 carries just twice this season. He remains the team's best runner between the 20s, but that means he does not offer a tremendous amount of high value touches for fantasy football. He closes his second regular season with 687 rushing yards and two scores on 156 carries, adding 38 receptions for another 269 yards.\n",

McKissic and Alvin Kamara were the only running backs who had more targets than Hines. Colts running backs combined for an incredible 134 targets thanks in large part to Philip Rivers' penchant for the check down. Jonathan Taylor had 41 targets in 15 games. Hines' overall usage made him hard to trust for fantasy purposes, as he only played 36 percent of the team's offensive snaps in 2020. He'll be a fringe option in Super Wild Card Weekend DFS.\u00a0\n",

Playing through a high-ankle sprain suffered in Week 15, it was gutsy on Akers' part just to be out there after the Rams lost Darrell Henderson (ankle) to I.R. last week. The 21 carries were actually surprising. Akers' only real mistake was a lost fumble at the goal line that Arizona recovered in the end zone, but it did lead to a Rams safety a couple plays later. Akers will look to carry the mail next week in the Wild Card round of the playoffs for L.A., assuming he avoided any setbacks with the ankle.\n",

Colts running backs combined for an incredible 134 targets thanks in large part to Philip Rivers' penchant for the check down. Jonathan Taylor had 41 targets in 15 games. Hines' overall usage made him hard to trust for fantasy purposes, as he only played 36 percent of the team's offensive snaps in 2020.

Leonard Fournette operated as the team's pass-catching back with LeSean McCoy out but only saw five carries. Jones looks to be back in the lead-runner role heading into the playoffs.

Many question Diggs' fit with Josh Allen after last spring's trade. The regular season results speak for themselves, with Diggs securing 127 catches for 1,535 yards and eight touchdowns. He remains one of the best players in the league at his position, and helped transformed the Bills offense into a juggernaut.\n",

He also tied Pittsburgh's rookie touchdowns mark with nine. Those are quite the accomplishments considering the wideouts who have come through Pittsburgh this century. Snap counted for much of the stretch run, Claypool was re-unveiled over the past two weeks and had two encouraging efforts to show for it.

With John Wolford under center and not throwing a touchdown, none of the Rams' wideouts did much of note. Woods will be tough to trust as anything more than a WR4 against Seattle in the Wild Card round if Wolford gets another start.\n",

    "analysis": "The Falcons simply couldn't keep Brown from burning them deep. He scored both of his touchdowns from at least 25 yards en route to his best day by receiving yards since Week 15 of 2018. Brown was able to rack up these numbers with Mike Evans sidelined for much of the game due to a non-contact knee injury. If Evans misses the opening round of the playoffs, Brown will likely take over his role as the team's high-volume field-stretcher. He would likely slot in as a borderline WR1 for the first week of fantasy playoffs if that is the case.\n",
