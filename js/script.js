He added 39 rushing yards on five carries.Wilson was incredible once again, keeping his club one step ahead of the Patriots' comeback attempts. The dual-threat quarterback completed touchdown passes to five different receivers in this one, bringing his season total up to nine through two contests. Wilson could be involved in yet another shootout next week against a Dallas squad that can put up points but has trouble preventing them.",

This kind of game script could become common for Baltimore this season, limiting the production of the team's superstar QB, but that shouldn't be an issue in Week 3 as Jackson and the Ravens go toe to toe with Patrick Mahomes and the defending Super Bowl champions from Kansas City.",

He also lost a fumble on the Cowboys' second offensive possession of the game.As if the three rushing scores did not already boost him toward a week-winning fantasy performance Sunday, Prescott's 450 passing yards were good for the third-most in his 66 career regular-season outings. Prescott's performance surely was enhanced by game script, as Dallas fell into a 29-10 halftime deficit, forcing the quarterback to put up 28 pass attempts in the third and fourth quarters in order to execute a comeback. With 716 passing yards already to his name in 2020, Prescott will next face a Seahawks defense that gave up 450 passing yards in its season debut.",

    "report": "Minshew completed 30 of 45 passes for 339 yards, three touchdowns and two interceptions and had four carries for 19 yards during Sunday's 33-30 loss to Tennessee.The 24-year-old was near perfect in the season-opening win against the Colts and found plenty of success through the air versus the Titans, though he did have the two giveaways Sunday. Minshew threw two touchdown passes in the fourth quarter to overcome a 13-point deficit, but Tennessee kicked a late field goal to take a late lead and Minshew subsequently threw a fourth-down interception with less than a minute left. He's completed 49 of his 65 pass attempts for 512 yards with six touchdowns and two interceptions through his first two games of the season. He has a Thursday night matchup with the Dolphins in Week 3.",

With Green Bay dominating on the ground, Rodgers' numbers took a step back after he threw for 364 yards and four touchdowns in the season opener. The veteran quarterback's week-to-week contributions will vary due to Green Bay's reliance on the ground game, but he's at the helm of an offense that's averaging 42.5 points per game. Up next is a Week 3 trip to New Orleans for a heavyweight battle on Sunday Night Football, and Rodgers could be without top receiver Davante Adams, who exited early with a hamstring injury.",

Regardless, he's thrown for multiple touchdowns in each game to start the season, and he has excellent matchups against Atlanta, Indianapolis and Carolina over the next four weeks, which may allow him to function as a top-24 quarterback during that time.",

The result was a big fantasy effort for the QB, who fell just short of scoring a game-winning rushing TD on the final play of the contest. As long as he can avoid the sort of injuries that his style of play can sometimes lead to, Newton's dual-threat ability gives him weekly fantasy upside if he continues to click with his wideouts, as he did versus Seattle. He'll take aim at the 1-0 Raiders at home this coming Sunday.",

    "report": "Watson completed 25 of 36 passes for 275 yards, one touchdown and one interception in Sunday's 33-16 loss to the Ravens. He also rushed five times for 17 yards.Watson's completion percentage was fine, but he missed some crucial throws in the Texans' second loss in two games. The most critical miss came on a fourth-and-one at their own 34 that gave Baltimore a short field for their first touchdown. The Ravens came prepared to shut down running back David Johnson, who gained just 34 yards on 11 carries, so it was up to Watson and the passing offense. He wasn't helped when Ravens linebacker L.J. Fort turned a Keke Coutee fumble into a touchdown. On a positive note, Watson connected with newcomers Brandin Cooks (five catches, 95 yards) and Randall Cobb (five, 59) after the pair were quiet in Week 1. Watson will try to avoid an 0-3 start in Week 3's road match against the 2-0 Steelers.",

Murray appears to be taking a huge step forward in his development this season, and he could be poised for another big game in Week 3 against a Lions defense that couldn't contain either Aaron Rodgers or Mitchell Trubisky in its first two contests.",

He made use of all his weapons as rookie Chase Claypool caught an 84-yard touchdown pass and second-year wideout Diontae Johnson added a 28-yard score of his own. The veteran took some time to get into the season opener against the Giants, but he's now posted a 5:1 TD:INT and has piled up 540 yassing yards on 73 attempts through two weeks. Roethlisberger will look to continue his bounceback campaign next Sunday in a favorable matchup against the Texans.",

    "headlineNews": "Bengals' Joe Burrow: Strong numbers in loss",
    "report": "Burrow completed 37 of 61 passes for 316 yards with three touchdowns and no interceptions in the Bengals' 35-30 loss to the Browns on Thursday. He also rushed seven times for 19 yards and had two fumbles, losing one.The rookie finished with a strong line despite much of his success coming in the shorter areas of the field, as evidenced by his 5.2 yards per attempt. Burrow did appear to take another step forward in his development through sheer volume of reps if nothing else, and he connected with three different pass catchers in C.J. Uzomah (Achilles), Mike Thomas and Tyler Boyd for his trio of scoring tosses. Burrow's last two scoring drives impressively covered extended stretches of the field, as he led the Bengals on marches of 83 yards on 14 plays and 75 yards over 16 plays in the fourth quarter. The 2020 first overall pick will now get some extra time to rest his arm, work on ball security and build further rapport with his pass-catching corps ahead of a tough Week 3 road test against the Eagles on Sunday, Sept. 27.",

    "report": "Brady completed 23 of 35 passes for 217 yards with one touchdown and one interception in the Buccaneers' 31-17 win over the Panthers on Sunday. He also netted zero yards on his one rush and lost a fumble.Following a season-opening loss to the Saints in which he threw two interceptions, including a pick-six, Brady checked into Sunday's second straight divisional matchup looking to right the ship. Despite being hampered by the absence of Chris Godwin (concussion), the future Hall of Famer was able to put together a solid effort that nevertheless saw him commit two turnovers once again. However, as opposed to his miscues against New Orleans, the mistakes didn't come at critical moments for the Buccaneers. Brady also commemorated his second touchdown pass to Mike Evans in style, hitting his top wideout for a nifty 23-yard score in the latter portion of the first quarter to up Tampa Bay's lead to 13-0 pending Ryan Succop's extra point, and he saw running back LeSean McCoy drop a perfectly placed pass in the end zone that would have given him a second scoring toss. Brady clearly still has some more kinks to work out while adapting to coach Bruce Arians' scheme, and having Godwin potentially back at his  disposal in a Week 3 interconference road battle against the Broncos would help in that regard.",

    "report": "Mayfield completed 16 of 23 passes for 219 yards with two touchdowns and one interception in the Browns' 35-30 win over the Bengals on Thursday. He also rushed three times for six yards.After a fairly dismal season-opening performance in a thorny matchup against the Ravens, Mayfield was set up nicely for a bounce-back effort in Week 2, considering the significant step down in competition. The oft-maligned quarterback mostly maximized his favorable circumstances, helping the Browns jump out to a 14-3 lead via a 43-yard touchdown connection with Odell Beckham. Mayfield subsequently capped off another second-quarter scoring drive with a six-yard toss to Kareem Hunt, and although he did throw an early fourth-quarter interception, it came on a deep downfield pass into Bengals territory. The numbers Thursday weren't markedly different for Mayfield than his 189-yard, one-touchdown, one-interception performance against Baltimore, but the fact he went 7-for-9 when targeting his top duo of Beckham and Jarvis Landry offers reason for optimism. Mayfield will look to keep his momentum going in a Week 3 home date against the Washington Football Team on Sunday, Sept. 27.",

    "headlineNews": "Falcons' Matt Ryan: Great start to 2020 continues",
    "report": "Ryan completed 24 of 36 pass attempts for 273 yards and four touchdowns during Sunday's 40-39 loss to the Cowboys. He also ran for 16 yards on four carries during the game.From a statistical perspective, the four-time Pro Bowler is playing out of this world to kick off his 13th NFL campaign, with a 67.8 percent completion rate, 723 passing yards, and a 6:1 TD:INT through Week 2. Atlanta's secondary continues to get torched on the opposite side of the ball, making it very feasible that Ryan finishes top six among quarterbacks in pass attempts for a fifth straight season. Last year the Falcons led the entire NFL in passes, and so far this year Ryan has launched an astronomical 90 attempts. Next up is a showdown against a Bears defense that just handed the Giants' Daniel Jones his first career start without a touchdown pass.",

The 32-year-old signal-caller was capable of putting up decent production against Green Bay last week with his team trailing throughout the second half, as he wrapped up with 259 passing yards and two touchdowns. Minnesota had only four offensive possessions throughout the entirety of the second half Sunday against Indianapolis, with the first three opportunities going interception, punt, punt on a combined 11 plays. Cousins will look to get back on track Week 3 with the Vikings taking on a Titans defense that gave up 339 passing yards and three touchdowns to Jacksonville's Gardner Minshew on Sunday.",

He also lost a fumble.A game script that saw the Panthers down by 21-0 by halftime worked in favor of Bridgewater's fantasy managers, as it required the veteran quarterback to constantly put the ball up in the second half. Bridgewater unsurprisingly made a couple of errors with that level of volume, and considering he was under constant duress while getting sacked five times. Despite the high number of completions, however, Bridgewater only completed passes to three wideouts overall -- D.J. Moore, Robby Anderson and Curtis Samuel -- with all but two of of his other connections transpiring with running backs Mike Davis and Christian McCaffrey. Through two games, Bridgewater has rewarded managers with a whopping 637 passing yards, but that's been accompanied by a pedestrian one touchdown versus two interceptions. Bridgewater will look to helm a more balanced offense in a Week 3 road interconference battle against the Chargers.",

The Saints' passing game clearly missed top wideout Michael Thomas, often resulting in Brees dumping passes down to tailback Alvin Kamara. Although Tre'Quan Smith did rather admirably with some crossing routes and Brees hit Jared Cook for a six-yard touchdown, his accuracy waned on longer attempts downfield. The 41-year-old also threw an uncharacteristically poor interception right to a defender prior to halftime. While Brees did rack up some yards while facing soft coverage late, he'll still be eager for a much improved performance in Week 3 versus the Packers whether Thomas suits up or not.",

He also rushed four times for 18 yards.Allen ended up having to do plenty in a game that the Bills were fairly solid favorites in, averaging 11.9 yards per attempt while connecting with eight different pass catchers on the afternoon. The third-year signal caller hit the eclectic quartet of Stefon Diggs, John Brown, Gabriel Davis and Reggie Gilliam for his scoring throws, the final one a 46-yarder to Brown to give Buffalo critical separation with 3:09 remaining. Perhaps almost as encouraging for the Bills' coaching staff was Allen's mistake-free effort, as well as his burgeoning connection with Diggs, whom he targeted a team-high 13 times on the way to an 8-153-1 day for the wideout. Allen will look to build on this landmark effort when the Bills battle the Los Angeles Rams in a Week 3 home matchup.",

He also rushed three times for 12 yards and  threw a two-point conversion pass.It wasn't pretty at times, but Fitzpatrick overcome a relatively slow start to keep the Dolphins in the contest until an unsuccessful onside kick with 49 seconds remaining. The veteran particularly hit his stride in the fourth quarter, leading Miami to a pair of scoring marches that went for a combined 19 plays and 119 yards. The latter drive culminated in Fitzpatrick's second and final touchdown of the day, an eight-yard strike to Mike Gesicki that he followed up with a two-point conversion to Preston Williams that brought the Fins within a field goal. Fitzpatrick notably kept his target distribution narrow -- only Gesicki, Isaiah Ford, DeVante Parker and running back Myles Gaskin recorded multiple receptions -- but the 37-year-old did enough to keep his grip on the starting job. Fitzpatrick will try to once again lead his team to its first win of the season in a Week 3 Thursday night road matchup upstate against the Jaguars.",

He turned it up a notch in the second half and helped his team draw level with a 54-yard touchdown pass to Tyreek Hill in the fourth quarter. Mahomes then led a methodical 13-play drive in overtime to set up the winning field goal, completing crucial passes to Hill and Clyde Edwards-Helaire to set it up. The superstar signal-caller now has five touchdowns and 513 yards with no interceptions through two games and will look to continue his excellent start next Monday night in a tough matchup with the Ravens.",

    "report": "Haskins completed 19 of 33 passes for 223 yards and a touchdown while rushing for eight yards on one carry in Sunday's 30-15 loss to the Cardinals.Washington was down by 14 points by the end of the first quarter and 20-0 at the half, but Haskins wasn't able to engineer a comeback win for the second straight week. The second-year QB continues to show great chemistry with Terry McLaurin, but none of his other targets were able to make a significant impact.  Haskins may need to get other players involved on the road in Week 3 if he's going to keep pace with a Browns offense that just erupted for 35 points against the Bengals.",

After being sacked eight times in Week 1, his offensive line gave up no sacks to Aaron Donald and Co., yet Wentz was unable to get anything going in this one. Philly will look to get back on track next week as the schedule lightens up in an easier matchup with Cincinnati that could be a get-right spot for the Philadelphia offense.",

The nature of Lock's rotator/labral injury puts him at risk of missing up to six weeks, so Driskel could see the opportunity to make a number of starts. The journeyman signal-caller performed well in relief of Lock against Pittsburgh's vaunted defense Sunday, when he completed 18 of 34 pass attempts for 256 yards, two touchdowns and one interception, but he'll have to manage without top wideout Courtland Sutton (knee) going forward.",

    "report": "Rivers completed 19 of 25 pass attempts for 214 yards, one touchdown and one interception during Sunday's 28-11 win over the Vikings.Although Rivers managed a respectable average of 8.6 yards per attempt against a vulnerable Vikings secondary, he finished with just 25 attempts as the Colts relied on the running game to control the win. He threw a short touchdown pass to Zach Pascal to add a slight boost to his fantasy production, but he still finished with lackluster numbers overall and now has a 2:3 TD:INT through two games. Rivers will enjoy a favorable matchup next Sunday against the Jets and will look to jumpstart his season after mixed results in the early going.",

Through two games, Goff has totaled just 58 pass attempts after leading the NFL with 626 attempts in 2019. Instead, the Rams have opted for a more run-heavy approach, putting the ball in Goff's hands less. He's still got some streaming appeal in favorable matchups, but he's not a weekly must-start option due to the lack of volume and focus on the ground game.",

He also gained 21 yards on three carries.Jones was strip-sacked on the opening drive, went three-and-out on the following drive and threw a pick on the Giants' third possession. New York entered the locker room scoreless at halftime, with Jones posting just 73 passing yards. He started to get rolling toward the end of the third quarter and nearly salvaged the otherwise ugly showing with a last-second TD drive, but Golden Tate was called for offensive pass interference in the end zone, marking the end of the game. It was an unfortunate outing after the second-year QB showed some promise in Week 1 against the Steelers. However, the bigger storyline may be RB Saquon Barkley potentially tearing his ACL in the first half Sunday. If that's the case, Jones will carry a heavy burden in Week 3 against the 49ers.",

He added 12 rushing yards on four carries.So much for Tannehill's regression to the mean, as the 2019 Comeback Player of the Year continues to tear up the league, posting another multi-TD passing performance in Week 2. With Sunday's outing, Tannehill now has multiple passing scores in nine consecutive regular-season outings, with three or more passing TDs in three of those appearances. Tannehill's efficiency during that span is remarkable -- he has averaged only 26.2 pass attempts per game since Week 10 of last season. If Tannehill has been a stalwart of your fantasy lineup so far, Week 3 would not be the time to pull him as he goes up against a Vikings defense that has surrendered 578 passing yards and five passing touchdowns through its first two appearances of the year.",

He also rushed twice for seven yards.Darnold focused on getting the ball out of his hand quickly to slow down San Francisco's pass rush. He was sacked only once, but Darnold failed to orchestrate much offense outside of a 30-yard touchdown to Braxton Berrios in garbage time. Breshad Perriman (ankle) and Chris Hogan (ribs) both left the game, leaving New York without its top four wide receivers with Jamison Crowder (hamstring) and Denzel Mims (hamstring) inactive. Given his lack of weapons, Darnold will be fighting an uphill battle in Week 3 against a Colts team that's coming off a convincing win over the Vikings.",

The signal-caller built up a streak of completions and was particularly sharp on third downs, with his first two touchdowns coming then. Carr upped the ante for his third score, tossing a one-yarder on fourth-and-goal to start the second half and give Las Vegas the lead. That TD went to tight end Darren Waller, who easily paced the team in all receiving categories, but to his credit, Carr connected with 11 different pass-catchers Monday. Such distribution should have Carr feeling confident ahead of Week 3's trip to New England.",

    "report": "Coach Anthony Lynn has confirmed that Herbert will start Sunday's game against the Panthers,Daniel Popper of The Athletic reports.This was expected, with Taylor having suffered a punctured lung  prior to Week 2's kickoff. Though Lynn notes that the Chargers haven't considered placing Taylor on IR, the team won't take any chances with the veteran signal-caller, given that he's understandably not 100 percent. Taylor will presumably be officially ruled out by the end of the week, while Herbert will have an opportunity to build off his strong NFL debut in Week 1's overtime loss to the Chiefs, versus an 0-2 Carolina squad that will be missing star running back Christian McCaffrey (ankle).",

    "headlineNews": "Saints' Alvin Kamara: Two touchdowns in defeat",
    "report": "Kamara rushed 13 times for 79 yards and two touchdowns in Monday night's 34-24 loss to the Raiders. He also caught all nine of his targets for 95 yards.Kamara was dynamic in the absence of top wideout Michael Thomas, as he led the Saints in all major receiving categories while benefitting from the team trailing most of the second half. The tailback also dazzled on the ground, improving greatly on his mere 16 rushing yards Week 1. Just like in the season opener, however, Kamara again scored twice, with Monday's scores both coming from inside of five yards. As one of the league's most dangerous playmakers, Kamara should remain a big threat whether or not Thomas is available Week 3 versus the Packers, but he sports extra upside in the passing game if his teammate is sidelined again.",

The back's receiving skills had been a work in progress when he entered the league, but Elliott has now averaged 4.2 catches per game dating back to the start of 2018 (compared to 2.3 receptions per game between 2016 and 2017). Fresh off a comeback win, Elliott and the Cowboys' rushing attack now prepare for a Week 3 matchup against a Seahawks defense that contained Atlanta to 72 team rushing yards in its season debut.",

    "report": "Gurley registered 61 rushing yards on 21 carries, and he was not targeted during Sunday's 40-39 loss to the Cowboys.Immediate indications of Gurley's overall workload are encouraging, but the lack of passing game usage is slightly troubling in the early going of his Falcons career. That element was crucial to him becoming an All-Pro and fantasy rockstar between 2017 and 2018. Gurley did see his receiving involvement decrease substantially last year as he garnered only 49 targets in his final season as a Ram, but at his peak the two years prior, Gurley accounted for better than 60 catches per year with an average of 684 receiving yards and five receiving touchdowns. Through two games in Atlanta, Gurley has just two catches for one yard, while backup Brian Hill has tallied four catches for 19 yards. Gurley does have 35 carries through his first two outings, but given that he's running behind a line that allowed the sixth-most stuffs in 2019, rushing opportunities may not be an uber-efficient route to fantasy production.",

    "report": "Ekeler carried the ball 16 times for 93 yards and caught all four of his targets for 55 yards in Sunday's 23-20 overtime loss to Kansas City.While it was an impressive performance for Ekeler, it could have been bigger -- quarterback Justin Herbert ran in a four-yard TD while Joshua Kelley also topped the century mark in scrimmage yards on 25 touches. The Chargers' backfield increasingly looks like a 1A/1B arrangement rather than Ekeler being entrusted with lead duties, but that could still lead to big numbers for both backs in Week 3 against a Panthers run defense that's already been lit up by Josh Jacobs and Leonard Fournette this season.",

    "report": "Carson rushed 17 times for 72 yards and caught all three targets for 36 yards and a touchdown in Sunday's 35-30 win over the Patriots.Any worries about Carson's six-carry Week 1 can be dismissed, as the fourth-year pro handled 68 percent of the RB carries for the Seahawks in Week 2. He's been quite effective as a receiver, too, catching an end-zone target from Russell Wilson in the fourth quarter that went down as the winning score. Carlos Hyde and Travis Homer will continue to get some work in the backfield, but Carson is the unequivocal No. 1 RB and should be utilized in fantasy as such. Carson will have a tough test Week 3, however, as the Cowboys just held the Falcons' Todd Gurley to 2.9 yards per carry.",

Given his productivity in the face of adversity this week, Conner figures to dominate the touches again next Sunday against the Texans. Injuries remain a concern, however, so fantasy managers will hope he doesn't feel any lingering effects heading into the contest.",

Robinson again dominated the touches out of the backfield as Chris Thompson was the only other running back to touch the ball (two carries and three receptions), though the veteran did catch a touchdown pass. Next week's opponent, the Dolphins, have surrendered 328 rushing yards through their first two games of the season, so Robinson should be able to find running room in Week 3.",

However, the third-year back then saw coach Bruce Arians afford Jones' backfield mate Leonard Fournette plenty of work, leading to the latter posting a 12-103-2 line on the afternoon. Despite Arians' preseason proclamation that Jones was the clear lead back, there was still a certain degree of uncertainty until the games began, and as Week 2 demonstrated, Arians could opt to go with a hot-hand philosophy in his backfield the majority of weeks. Jones will look to make up for a relatively pedestrian Week 2 effort in a tough Week 3 road matchup against the Broncos next Sunday.",

    "report": "Montgomery rushed 16 times for 82 yards while catching all three of his targets for 45 yards and a touchdown in Chicago's 17-13 victory over the Giants on Sunday.For the first time in his career, Montgomery exceeded five yards per rushing attempt, as he was frequently able to get into space and make defenders miss. In addition, he out-targeted backfield mate Tarik Cohen for the second week in a row, and it would appear that he's a player the coaching staff is preparing to lean on throughout the season. However, it should be noted that he's been productive against a pair of weak run defenses, though his current role in the offense provides optimism that he can be trusted as a top-24 running back option each week.",

He was also targeted twice in the passing game but recorded zero receptions.The Jacksonville defense stepped up against the NFL's leading rusher from 2019, containing Henry to a meager 3.4 yards per rush after he accumulated an absurd 7.0 yards per carry in his four preceding outings against the Jaguars. Combining Sunday's results with Henry's Week 1 performance (3.7 YPC), the 2019 Pro Bowler is off to an inefficient start to 2020, though he is still benefitting from a gargantuan workload. The 26-year-old has already garnered 59 offensive touches through Tennessee's first two outings, as the Titans now prepare for a Week 3 matchup against  the 0-2 Vikings.",

    "report": "Cook collected 63 yards and a rushing touchdown on 14 carries, while also corralling both of his targets for eight receiving yards during Sunday's 28-11 loss to Indianapolis.Cook had averaged 17.5 carries per game over his past 15 regular-season outings entering Week 2, but the Vikings were less able to lean on the team's Pro Bowl back down the stretch, having fallen into a 15-point deficit by the 9:27 mark of the third quarter. The Colts' lead would only balloon from there, leaving Cook with a workload of 16 or fewer offensive touches for the third consecutive game. Despite just 119 scrimmage yards to his name thus far this season, Cook's fantasy value has been largely salvaged by his three touchdowns -- each of which has come via a goal-line rush attempt. The star back may get it going in the yardage department in Week 3, when the Vikings take on a Titans defense that surrendered 165 team rush yards to Jacksonville on Sunday.",

    "report": "Singletary rushed 10 times for 56 yards and brought in two of three targets for 20 yards in the Bills' 31-28 win over the Dolphins on Sunday.While the Bills backfield situation continues to be a fantasy quagmire, Singletary at least slightly outpaced rookie Zack Moss in rushes during Sunday's contest and also saw two receiving touches to his teammate's none. Singletary also was the more efficient back with 5.6 yards per carry, though Moss's 4.6 figure wasn't disappointing by any stretch. The good news for both backs is that it appears it's them or bust when it comes to Buffalo's ground game, but whether Singletary can do enough to separate from his first-year competitor on a week-to-week basis remains to be seen. Singletary will look to build on Sunday's serviceable numbers against the Rams in a Week 3 home matchup.",

With rookie J.K. Dobbins coming off a big debut last week and Lamar Jackson also getting heavy usage on the ground, Ingram's production could remain erratic all year, but if he gets a healthy workload he could deliver a strong return in Week 3 against a Kansas City defense that just gave up over 100 scrimmage yards to both Austin Ekeler and Joshua Kelley in an overtime victory.",

He managed to bring in a 16-yard touchdown pass from Jeff Driskel in the fourth quarter en route to the best performance of his young Broncos career. Gordon's uptick in offensive output was in part due to the absence of Phillip Lindsay (toe), and he showed he can still produce  when given 20-plus touches per game.

    "report": "Taylor carried 26 times for 101 yards and a touchdown Sunday against the Vikings. He also caught both his targets for nine additional yards in the 28-11 win.Taylor stepped in for the injured Marlon Mack (Achilles) and churned out 110 scrimmage yards against a respectable defense, though his average of 3.9 yards per carry was a bit lackluster. He scored his first career rushing touchdown on a five-yard carry in the second quarter and helped his team control the game after jumping out to a big lead in the second half. Taylor should see a similar workload next Sunday against the Jets and should be considered an ascending fantasy option heading into a contest Indianapolis is expected to win.",

    "report": "Kelley carried the ball a team-high 23 times for 64 yards and caught two of three targets for 49 yards in Sunday's 23-20 overtime loss to Kansas City.It's noteworthy that Kelley saw a bigger workload than Austin Ekeler in a close game, with the rookie getting 25 touches to the more senior back's 20 -- although Ekeler was more productive with 148 scrimmage yards. The Chargers' backfield increasingly looks like a 1A/1B arrangement rather than Kelley being confined to backup duties, but that could still lead to big numbers for both backs in Week 3 against a Panthers run defense that's already been lit up by Josh Jacobs and Leonard Fournette this season.",

    "report": "Fournette rushed 12 times for 103 yards and two touchdowns and brought in four of five targets for 13 yards in the Buccaneers' 31-17 win over the Panthers on Sunday.The Buccaneers entered the matchup against their divisional opponent likely knowing the ground game was poised for success, but given previous statements by coach Bruce Arians, that scenario appeared to set up best for Fournette's backfield mate Ronald Jones. While the latter did find the end zone once, Fournette had the better and splashier performance by far. The former Jaguar first pushed in a one-yard score late in the third quarter to extend Tampa Bay's lead to three touchdowns, then he put an exclamation point on his afternoon with a key 46-yard scamper with 1:48 remaining that snuffed out any hope of a Panthers comeback after they'd narrowed the deficit to seven. Fournette displayed excellent downhill speed on the run, and given the caliber of his numbers, he may have made an irrefutable case for a greater share of the rushing workload moving forward. Fournette will look to build on Sunday's body of work in a tough Week 3 road tilt against the Broncos next Sunday.",

He was held to 50 yards from scrimmage after crossing the century mark (109 yards) last week. With Duke Johnson (ankle) inactive, David Johnson gobbled up all the running back targets and finished tied for fourth in total targets with tight end Darren Fells. David Johnson looks to rebound Week 3 on the road against a Pittsburgh defense that is holding backs to 2.9 yards per carry through two weeks.",

    "report": "Snell ran three times for five yards and lost a fumble in Pittsburgh's 26-21 win over Denver on Sunday.Coming off his 113-yard effort in relief of James Conner (ankle) last week, it was thought that Snell might split carries against the Broncos. Instead, he saw just four touches, including a four-yard loss on his only reception of the game. His fumble in the fourth quarter made the game interesting but the Steelers held on to go 2-0 for the first time since 2016. With Conner healthy, Snell will likely take a backseat in Week 3 against the Texans.",

He was much more involved as a pass catcher, however, and demonstrated the ability that made him such a tantalizing fantasy prospect leading up to the season. Despite a rather meager per-touch output in Week 2, the rookie still has 208 scrimmage yards and a touchdown through his first two NFL contests. Edwards-Helaire could find the sledding tough next Monday night against Baltimore, but his multi-faceted skillset should allow him to generate ample fantasy utility.",

He's excited for it and we're excited to see him.\"Shanahan's quote all but confirms Mostert and Coleman will miss the game and McKinnon will step up as the lead back. However, a starting job doesn't automatically equate to massive usage, as Shanahan has shown a strong preference for using multiple running backs in his gameplans. Jeff Wilson could also get some work, especially near the goal line, and JaMycal Hasty may be promoted from the practice squad later this week.",

    "report": "Brown (finger) won't practice Wednesday, Jourdan Rodrigue of The Athletic reports.Brown's snap count has been consistent through two games, but his touch count dropped from 21 in Week 1 to 11 this past Sunday at Philadelphia. Perhaps the broken left pinky finger he suffered in the latter game caused coach Sean McVay to call Brown's name less, but his status now is in some question for a Week 3 visit to Buffalo. Elsewhere in the backfield, rookie Cam Akers also is sitting out Wednesday due to separated rib cartilage, so Darrell Henderson is the healthiest of the Rams' running back trio.",

    "report": "Mixon rushed 16 times for 46 yards and brought in all four targets for 40 yards in the Bengals' 35-30 loss to the Browns on Thursday.Mixon was an absolute terror against Cleveland in his two meetings with Browns last season, exceeding a combined 300 rushing yards in that pair of contests. The defense was clearly focused on not allowing the fourth-year back to have his way yet again, shutting Mixon down for 2.9 yards per rush and a long gain of just nine yards. The Oklahoma product was encouragingly more involved in the passing game than during the team's Week 1 loss to the Chargers, and he's likely to continue building rapport with rookie quarterback Joe Burrow in that regard as the season unfolds. Mixon will now turn his attention to a Week 3 road matchup against the Eagles' elite run defense on Sunday, Sept. 27.",

    "report": "Chubb rushed 22 times for 124 yards and two touchdowns and brought in his only target for nine yards in the Browns' 35-30 win over the Bengals on Thursday.Chubb and backfield mate Kareem Hunt put on a clinic against the porous Bengals front seven, with the two combining for an average of 6.6 yards per rush on 32 carries. For his part, Chubb saw a nice bump in workload from a Game 1 tally of 10 carries, comfortably outpacing Hunt in that department by 12 rushing touches overall after having trailed his teammate by three against Baltimore four days earlier. The third-year pro's 11-yard trip to the end zone in the first quarter opened the scoring on the night for Cleveland, and Chubb later added a one-yard touchdown in the latter stages of the third quarter to extend the Browns' lead to double digits. The fact the Week 2 rushing workload tilted much heavier in Chubb's direction had to elicit a sigh of relief from fantasy mangers for the time being, and the Georgia product will look to put together a successful encore at the expense of the Washington Football Team in a Week 3 home tilt on Sunday, Sept. 27.",

    "headlineNews": "Patriots' Sony Michel: Rushes for 19 yards",
    "report": "Michel carried seven times for 19 yards in Sunday's 35-30 loss to Seattle.Once again, QB Cam Newton was the team's top rushing threat, logging 11 carries for 47 yards and two TDs on the ground. Meanwhile, Rex Burkhead carried six times for two yards and J.J. Taylor lost a yard on his only carry. Pass-catching ace James White (personal) was inactive for Sunday's game, but his usual role was largely handled by Burkhead, who caught four of his six targets for 47 yards, while Michel didn't haul in his only Week 2 target. Looking ahead, Michel's fantasy prospects hinge on game flows that favor the run in weeks where the Patriots choose to limit Newton's touches in that phase of the game. In that context, Michel profiles as a hit-or-miss option heading into Week 3's contest versus the Raiders.",

Smith garnered all five of his touches between quarters one and three, but when the game tightened up in the final frame, Todd Gurley received 100 percent of the running back workload. The Falcons will try to right the ship Week 3 against the Bears, as they face off against a Chicago defense that ranks among the league's stingiest units with just 163 rushing yards allowed so far to opposing RBs.",

    "report": "Gaskin rushed seven times for 46 yards and brought in six of seven targets for 36 yards in the Dolphins' 31-28 loss to the Bills on Sunday.The Dolphins' backfield touches were once again spread fairly evenly among Gaskin, Matt Breida and Jordan Howard, but it was Gaskin who had the clear overall lead in total touches. That was thanks to the second-year back's expanded receiving role, which saw him check in third in receptions and fourth in targets on the day. Breida is also a capable pass catcher, so he could certainly see an expanded role in that capacity in future weeks as well, but Gaskin has encouragingly been a focal point over the first pair of games by garnering double-digit touches in each contest. The University of Washington product will look to boost his production again in a Week 3 road matchup against the Jaguars on Thursday night.",

    "report": "Hunt rushed 10 times for 86 yards and a touchdown and brought in both his targets for 15 yards and another score in the Browns' 35-30 win over the Bengals on Thursday.For the second time in four days, Hunt was particularly efficient on the ground, and he averaged 8.4 yards per play on the 12 occasions he got his hands on the ball overall Thursday. While the 2017 third-round pick did play a clear second fiddle to backfield mate Nick Chubb in terms of rushing workload after outpacing him by three carries in Week 1, Hunt still offered plenty from a fantasy perspective with six-yard receiving score in the second quarter and a game-sealing one-yard scoring run in the fourth quarter. It's likely Chubb remains the clear lead back on most weeks, but as Hunt has demonstrated on several occasions since stepping into game action for the Browns midway through last season, he's capable of making very good use of his opportunities. He'll look to put together another strong performance against the Washington Football Team in a Week 3 home battle on Sunday, Sept. 27.",

Freeman inked a $3 million deal Tuesday and could eventually lead the backfield in touches, although the Giants may utilize a committee approach at first to ease him in.",

    "report": "Dobbins had two carries for 48 yards Sunday against the Texans. He added one 13-yard reception on one target.Dobbins' usage was surprisingly low Sunday after his impressive two-touchdown debut Week 1. He played 20 snaps, which was the same amount as Gus Edwards, but Edwards had 10 carries for a team-high 73 yards. The Ravens have deployed a fairly even backfield rotation thus far with Mark Ingram leading the way with 48 percent of the snap share while Dobbins has played 43 percent of the snaps and Edwards checks in at 35 percent. Dobbins did not see his first carry until midway through the third quarter. The rookie has plenty of talent, but consistent volume could be hard to come by with the Ravens using such a deep running back rotation, not to mention Lamar Jackson's contributions to the run game as well.",

Thompson has had a minor role as Jacksonville's pass-catching back, but even with QB Gardner Minshew attempting 45 passes, he wasn't a consistent factor in the offense. UDFA James Robinson has clearly established himself as the team's lead back, and at this point it doesn't look like there's much more production to be had in the backfield behind him.",

    "headlineNews": "Cardinals' Chase Edmonds: Notches six touches Sunday",
    "report": "Edmonds tallied three rushes for four yards and gathered in three of four targets for nine yards during Sunday's 30-15 win versus Washington.After playing 28 snaps on offense and scoring a TD on nine touches in the Cardinals' Week 1 victory at San Francisco, Edmonds logged 27 such plays but didn't find pay dirt on six touches one week later. Meanwhile, starting running back Kenyan Drake has racked up 108 offensive snaps and scooped up most of the backfield work (40 total touches). Edmonds will make the occasional splash play, like he did in the season opener, but as long as Drake is healthy, the former will have outings like Sunday's more often than not.",

Akers' timetable to return is unclear, but it's likely Henderson continues to see his role grow after this electric performance. He garnered just three more touches than Malcolm Brown, but Henderson outgained him 121-47. The Rams face a tough test against Buffalo in Week 3.",

Hines' usage is a bit confounding, but it's likely just a byproduct of a game that became a rout in the second half, and the Colts decided to use Wilkins to run out the clock. Sunday's game more likely highlights how Taylor is set to get the bulk of work with Hines in a more limited backup role than many expected. Hines should still have a larger workload in games where the team needs to make more throws to running backs.",

Todd Gurley soaked up 72.4 percent of Falcons running back carries against the Cowboys, while Ito Smith earned five carries of his own, limiting Hill to a bit role in the offensive operation. He will continue to be a complementary piece in the Atlanta backfield, but Gurley remains the unquestioned No. 1 heading into a Week 3 matchup against the Bears' 11th-ranked rush defense.",

Dobbins scored twice in the Ravens' opener, it looked like Edwards had been relegated to the bottom of the depth chart, but only Lamar Jackson carried the ball more often Sunday than he did. There was plenty of yards to go around for the entire Baltimore backfield -- the team amassed 230 rushing yards in total -- but it could be tough to predict from week to week which RB will see the biggest share. Edwards could still be productive on limited touches in Week 3 against a Kansas City defense that just gave up over 100 scrimmage yards to both Austin Ekeler and Joshua Kelley in an overtime victory.",

However, any hope of Hyde splitting reps with Carson has essentially been extinguished, as Carson will be the unequivocal lead back as long as he stays healthy. Hyde is a solid insurance policy in deeper formats, but Travis Homer could get some reps as well if Carson gets hurt.",

The increase in McCoy's role compared to the opener was at least mildly encouraging, but it remains to be seen whether it will hold in a Week 3 road matchup against the Broncos.",

Besides that, Alvin Kamara found himself in the midst of a magical night, racking up 79 yards and two touchdowns on the ground as well as 95 receiving yards on a combined 22 offensive touches. Murray wasn't able to put forth a noteworthy performance against his former team, but now he'll focus on a Packers defense that has surrendered 4.9 yards per rush to opposing running backs through two weeks.",

Wilkins got most of his carries late in the game when it became a blowout, so he's still likely the third running back with Nyheim Hines likely ahead of him and more likely to get work on passing downs. Either way, Sunday's game showed that Taylor is likely to get the majority of touches in the backfield.",

    "report": "Davis appears set to start Sunday's game against the Chargers following the placement of Christian McCaffrey (ankle) on IR, ESPN.com reports.Davis only had one carry against the Buccaneers in Week 2, but he did make some explosive plays in the passing game while catching all eight of his targets for 74 yards. The veteran journeyman won't slot into the 95-plus percent of snaps role that McCaffrey held, so Trenton Cannon, Curtis Samuel and Reggie Bonnafon (practice squad) could also see increased carries versus Los Angeles, but Davis looks like the clear favorite to lead Carolina's backfield. How well Davis fares against the Chargers' formidable defensive front could play a role in determining whether he keeps the starting gig for the entire duration of McCaffrey's expected 4-to-6 week IR stint.",

    "report": "Mattison registered three carries for 13 yards while also contributing one catch for three receiving yards during Sunday's 28-11 loss to the Colts.There seemed to be a fantasy-relevant role available for Mattison based on Week 1, as he collected 80 scrimmage yards on 10 touches while fielding 37 percent of the offensive snaps against the Packers. Week 2 was certainly disappointing in comparison; Mattison totaled only four offensive touches to Dalvin Cook's 16. The fact that Minnesota fell into a significant hole on the scoreboard mitigated Mattison's involvement, but if the Vikings can keep the score close or even take a lead Week 3 against Tennessee, the second-year back is more likely to get involved.",

The top four wide receivers on New York's depth chart are all injured, so the team continued to feed Gore despite trailing in the game from the very first play. Expect a similar game plan when New York travels to Indianapolis to take on another one of Gore's former teams.",

Booker looked explosive on a few plays, racking up a 15-yard run and 14-yard reception. He isn't likely to carry much standalone value, though Booker appears to be the back to roster in case of a Jacobs injury.",

    "headlineNews": "Vikings' Adam Thielen: Quiet day against Colts",
    "report": "Thielen caught three of eight targets for 31 receiving yards during Sunday's 28-11 loss to Indianapolis.It's not that Minnesota wasn't trying to feed the ball to the team's top perimeter weapon, as Thielen garnered twice as many targets as the No. 2 option, Irv Smith, during Sunday's defeat. In a similar game script Week 1, Thielen carved up Green Bay during junk time, registering two fourth-quarter scores as the Vikings tried to play catch up. With Minnesota again trailing by double digits in the second half Sunday, Kirk Cousins looked Thielen's way on five occasions. The two were unable to connect for a single completion in the third and fourth quarters, though Thielen did draw an illegal contact penalty as well as a pass interference call. If there is any consolation to invested fantasy GMs, it may be the fact that Thielen next draws a matchup against a Titans defense that surrendered 339 passing yards and three passing touchdowns to Jacksonville during Week 2.",

    "report": "Cooper snagged six of nine targets for 100 receiving yards during Sunday's 40-39 win against the Falcons.The four-time Pro Bowler was held to limited practice participation Thursday while nursing a bruised foot, but that certainly wasn't evident on the field Sunday as Cooper carved up the Falcons' porous secondary. Atlanta's defense was left depleted without cornerback Kendall Sheffield (foot) in the lineup, and Cooper was able to capitalize with his first 100-yard showing since Week 10 of last season. The 2015 No. 4 overall draft choice was shaky during the fantasy playoffs last December in posting sub-25-yard receiving outings in Weeks 15 and 17, but so far this season Cooper is off to a solid start with 80-plus receiving yards in each of his first two appearances. He and the Cowboys' prolific passing attack now travel to Seattle in Week 3 to take on a Seahawks pass defense that surrendered 450 passing yards to Atlanta in its season debut.",

Beckham bounced back in Thursday's win over the Bengals (four receptions for 74 yards and a touchdown), and at this point, the Browns remain committed to seeing if the wideout can continue to build chemistry with 2018 No. 1 overall pick Baker Mayfield. Including the current season, Beckham has four years at annual average salary of $15 million remaining on the contract extension he signed with the Giants in 2018 before being dealt to the Browns last offseason.",

Overall he finished second on the team in targets and scored for the second straight week while vastly improving his yardage output. Hill will face a tough matchup next Monday night against the Ravens, but his big-play ability and status as Patrick Mahomes' top wideout allow him a chance at big production every time he takes the field.",

Sunday, Diggs managed team-high totals in receptions, receiving yardage and targets while also making his first scoring connection with quarterback Josh Allen on a 22-yard grab early in the second quarter. Diggs' early usage implies coordinator Brian Daboll is already dialed in on how to best deploy him, leaving fantasy managers buoyant ahead of the Bills' Week 3 home matchup against the Rams next Sunday.",

    "report": "Metcalf caught four of six passes for 92 yards and a touchdown in Sunday's 35-30 win over the Patriots.Metcalf was shadowed by reigning Defensive Player of the Year Stephon Gilmore nearly all game. It was a tough battle, but Metcalf can declare a victory, as he hauled in a 54-yard TD pass in tight coverage in the first half and showed off his expanded route tree to snag three more over the course of the game. This is Metcalf's second straight game with more than 90 receiving yards and a score, and if Gilmore struggled to cover him, there will be few matchups that slow him down this year. Metcalf is a surefire fantasy start Week 3 when the Cowboys come to town after they allowed 273 passing yards and four scores to Matt Ryan and the Falcons on Sunday.",

    "report": "Green secured just three of 13 targets for 29 yards in the Bengals' 35-30 loss to the Browns on Thursday.Green found himself at the top of the passing-game pecking order in terms of looks, but was tied with rookie Tee Higgins for second-fewest receptions among the team's pass-catchers in Week 2. The multi-time Pro Bowler had a better connection going with rookie quarterback Joe Burrow during the Bengals' season opener against the Chargers and has now seen a whopping 22 targets through two contests. As Green further distances himself from the ankle injury that sidelined him last season, he and Burrow will look to continue developing their chemistry with the extra time afforded the team ahead of a Week 3 road interconference battle against the Eagles on Sunday, Sept. 27.",

The fact the Packers held a huge lead played a part in coach Matt LaFleur's thought process. On Wednesday, Adams also noted \"it's too early to tell\" where he stands at the moment, so his ability (or lack thereof) to return to the practice field Thursday and/or Friday may be the first tell for his availability for Sunday night's game at New Orleans.",

    "report": "Lockett caught seven of eight targets for 67 yards and a touchdown in Sunday's 35-30 win over the Patriots.Lockett was once against Russell Wilson's favorite target in Week 2, working underneath as DK Metcalf and David Moore took the top off the Patriots' defense. He's up to his usual efficiency, too, as Lockett has now reeled in 15 of 16 targets for 159 yards and a score this year. Metcalf has been targeted on the deeper passes -- an area in which Lockett also excels -- but the tandem is a clear 1A-1B where both should be considered viable fantasy starters on a weekly basis. The Seahawks have a favorable Week 3 matchup in store, as Dallas allowed Matt Ryan to throw for 273 yards and four scores Sunday.",

Although he was busy, a number of erratic passes from Mitch Trubisky led to multiple missed connections and a poor fantasy performance. However, with upcoming matchups against the Falcons and Colts, expect Robinson to return to the levels of performance that fantasy managers expected when selecting him on draft day.",

    "report": "Brown caught five of six targets for 42 yards Sunday against the Texans.Baltimore went to the air just 24  times Sunday, including just seven times in the second half. Even with the lower volume, Brown led the team in targets, receptions and yards Sunday. Brown has played 81 percent of the team's snaps, a significant uptick from the 60.4 percent he played as a rookie while working his way back from foot surgery. Not only is Brown playing a higher volume of snaps, he's also dominating the Baltimore passing game. He's seeing 113.0 air yards per game and has accounted for 47.3 percent of the Ravens' air yards. His aDOT is 18.8 yards, which is nearly the highest in the league. Brown and the Ravens will face the Chiefs in Week 3.",

While the Saints have two days of prep to go this week, it'll be mildly shocking if Thomas joins his teammates Thursday or Friday. If he does, though, he could begin putting himself in a position to play as soon as Sunday night against the Packers.",

Rampant touchdown production is nothing new for Ridley, as with two touchdowns Week 1 against the Seahawks, he tied Julio Jones for the most receiving TDs (19) through a player's first 30 games as a Falcon. Atlanta has put up an astronomical 90 pass attempts through its first two outings of the year, indicating that Ridley may continue to provide immense value so long as he can stay healthy. The slate becomes more difficult in Week 3, however, as the Falcons host a Bears defense that has allowed just one receiver to go over 65 yards thus far this season.",

    "report": "Moore secured eight of 13 targets for 120 yards in the Panthers' 31-17 loss to the Buccaneers on Sunday.A week after an underwhelming season-opening effort that saw him post a 4-54-0 line, Moore once again saw plenty of attention heaped on him by new quarterback Teddy Bridgewater. To the delight of fantasy managers, the results were markedly different, with Moore posting game-high totals in receiving yardage and targets while tying for second in receptions. Through two contests, Moore has now logged a robust 22 targets, an encouraging sign for the trust and chemistry he's manufactured with Bridgewater. Moore will look to build on Sunday's strong effort in a Week 3 interconference road battle versus the Chargers.",

However, Week 2 marked his breakout. Lamb and Amari Cooper torched the depleted Falcons secondary, combining for a dozen catches and more than 200 yards on the afternoon. Lamb contributed an enormous play in the waning stages of Sunday's contest, tearing off a 24-yard gain on Dallas' final drive to set up Greg Zuerlein with a 46-yard field goal for the walkoff win. The 21-year-old wideout carries momentum heading into a Week 3 matchup against a Seahawks defense that allowed three different wideouts to go for nine catches and 110-plus receiving yards in its season opener.",

    "headlineNews": "Cowboys' Michael Gallup: Held to two catches Sunday",
    "report": "Gallup caught two of five targets for 58 yards in Sunday's comeback win over the Falcons.He was fifth in targets on the day for the Cowboys, as Amari Cooper, CeeDee Lamb, Ezekiel Elliott and even tight end Dalton Schultz all saw more looks from Dak Prescott. Gallup did make his receptions count, however, hauling in a 20-yard pass late in the first half to set up a field goal and then making a leaping 38-yard grab along the sideline late in the fourth quarter that eventually led to Prescott's third rushing TD of the game. One of Dallas' trio of wide receivers is likely going to be on the back burner in any given week, but it won't necessarily be Gallup every time. He'll look to get more involved Week 3 against a Seahawks secondary that just gave up 397 passing yards to Cam Newton.",

The sixth-year wideout recorded a game-high 50-yard grab, and he also connected with Brady for a 23-yard touchdown catch in the latter portion of the first quarter for Tampa Bay's second touchdown of the day. Evans paced the pass-catching corps in receptions, receiving yardage and targets, unsurprising given Chris Godwin's (concussion) absence. Evans will look to thrive in a Week 3 road battle against the Broncos that should present a tougher matchup for the Bucs' passing game.",

His snap count decreased from 77 percent of those on offense Week 1 to 61 percent this past Sunday against Washington. Perhaps the groin issue is to blame, but his status nonetheless should be watched closely as the weekend draws closer.",

    "report": "Landry (hip) brought in all three of his targets for 46 yards in the Browns' 35-30 win over the Bengals on Thursday.The veteran managed his hip issues throughout the short practice week with limited practice reps, and it appears to have worked well in terms of keeping Landry out on the field for the second straight week. As in the season-opening loss to the Ravens, Landry's numbers were nothing spectacular, and in fact, checked in a tick below his 5-61 line against Baltimore. The passing game hasn't been much of a point of emphasis over the first two contests under new head coach Kevin Stefanski in part due to game script, but there will undoubtedly be times this season when Baker Mayfield and company will be called upon to do more. For the moment, Landry will try to benefit from the extra rest ahead of a Week 3 home date against the Washington Football Team on Sunday, Sept. 27.",

Through the first two weeks of the season, Jackson has grabbed eight receptions for 110 scoreless yards. Even as the de facto No. 1 option in the Eagles' passing attack, his weekly production is as volatile as its ever been, though he has a chance to finally strike paydirt when Philly takes on Cincinnati's exploitable secondary in Week 3.",

However, Boyd atoned for the error with time winding down, notching a nine-yard scoring grab  with 48 seconds remaining that brought the Bengals to within 35-30 and gave them a brief glimmer of hope. Boyd led the Cincinnati pass-catching corps in receptions and receiving yards Thursday, and for what it's worth, displayed a lot more efficiency with Burrow than top wideout A.J. Green, who could only bring in three of the 13 passes thrown his way. Boyd has 13 targets through the first two games despite Green's return to action, and he'll look to build on Thursday's effort in a Week 3 road matchup against the Eagles on Sunday, Sept. 27.",

Through two contests the second-year pro has just three catches on 12 targets, a dismal ratio even when factoring in that he's faced two of the league's top defenses (Buffalo and New England). Williams will get a solid opportunity to bounce back against Jacksonville's lackluster secondary in Week 3, but the Dolphins could consider decreasing his role on offense if he continues to struggle.",

Jefferson produced a 22-yard gain just before the half Sunday against Indianapolis, but it only amounted to a Hail-Mary chuck for his team as the Vikings were left at midfield with one second on the second-quarter clock after spiking the ball. Working within what has been anything but an explosive passing attack through two weeks -- the Minnesota offense has totaled 372 passing yards with two combined touchdowns -- Jefferson's upside is seemingly capped going into a Week 3 matchup against the Titans.",

    "report": "Hilton caught three of five targets for 28 yards during Sunday's 28-11 win over the Vikings.Despite facing a seemingly vulnerable Minnesota defense, Hilton didn't garner much attention from Philip Rivers and finished with a rather pedestrian stat line, thanks in part to a big drop on a potential deep touchdown pass. In fairness, the Colts controlled the game from the second quarter on and threw just 25 times total on the day. Still, it was a bit disappointing from a fantasy perspective to see his workload diminish despite the absences of Parris Campbell (knee) and Jack Doyle (knee/ankle), and he's totaled just 81 yards through two games in the Rivers era. Hilton will enjoy a favorable matchup next Sunday against the Jets and will look to take advantage, especially if his teammates remain out of the lineup.",

However, the touchdown saved his fantasy day, and the 28-year-old receiver should return to being more involved in the passing attack in Week 3. While Woods is definitely a tier or two behind the top fantasy wide receivers, his production floor is high, and he's also proven to be one of the more reliable weekly contributors during his tenure with the Rams.",

    "headlineNews": "Raiders' Hunter Renfrow: Big catches on MNF",
    "report": "Renfrow caught all three of his targets for 37 receiving yards during Monday's 34-24 win against the Saints.Renfrow recorded two receptions that spanned 15-plus yards, with one coming on the Raiders' second touchdown drive of the game in the late-second quarter, and the other on Las Vegas' TD drive in the fourth quarter. Tight end Darren Waller completely dominated the pass-catching workload in attracting 16 targets on the night, while not another Raider finished above three. Even with Derek Carr having thrown to a 73.5 percent completion rate and a 4:0 TD:INT, Renfrow has so far been a low-volume option in the passing game. If a breakout performance were to come for Renfrow in Week 3 against New England, it may come via red-zone usage, as he finished second on the team in red-zone looks last year with 10.",

He also lost a  fumble.Anderson was able to clear the century mark in receiving yardage for the second time in as many games in a Panthers uniform, once again displaying excellent chemistry with quarterback Teddy Bridgewater while pacing all pass catchers in receptions. The speedster did fumble early in the third quarter after a seven-yard catch, but Carolina got the ball right back on a Donte Jackson interception a play later. Anderson now has an elite 83.3 percent catch rate on his first 18 targets of the campaign, giving him no shortage of fantasy value and momentum heading into a Week 3 road interconference matchup against the Chargers.",

The 49ers were hurt by a slew of lower-body injuries sustained during Week 2, so this offense may look completely different while down two key running backs and, most likely, its starting quarterback. This could lead to more passing volume for Bourne and San Francisco's other top receiving options even with backup Nick Mullens under center, as Mullens proved to be a capable signal caller back in 2018.",

    "report": "Davis caught three of his five targets for 36 yards and a touchdown during Sunday's 33-30 win against the Jaguars.With A.J. Brown (knee) ruled out for Week 2, Davis tied Jonnu Smith for second on the team in targets as part of a balanced passing attack for Tennessee. The Titans characteristically ran the ball 34 times Sunday, while five different players posted at least two catches on Ryan Tannehill's 18 completions. Davis is off to an encouraging start to the campaign with 10 catches and 137 receiving yards through his first two outings, and Week 3 presents an enticing matchup as he goes up against a Vikings defense that has already allowed four different pass catchers to go for 60-plus receiving yards this season.",

He was fortunate on his touchdown reception, as Mitchell Trubisky threw the ball across the field, and Mooney was able to secure the football just before the defender could make a play. Mooney has been targeted three times while posting over 35 yards in each contest to start the season, and he's frequently seeing single coverage playing across the field from Allen Robinson, which will give him a chance to post regular production.  At this point, he's a player that fantasy managers should consider adding to rosters as a depth piece in the hopes he can boost his target volume in the upcoming weeks.",

    "report": "Brown hauled in four of six targets for 82 yards and a touchdown in the Bills' 31-28 win over the Dolphins on Sunday.More than half of Brown's receiving yardage came on one play, but it was a critical one. The veteran speedster made a 46-yard scoring grab with 3:09 remaining after the Dolphins had closed to within 24-20, with his score proving especially valuable after the Dolphins' Mike Gesicki notched an eight-yard touchdown with 49 seconds left. Brown is playing a clear second fiddle to new arrival Stefon Diggs in the early going this season, but that's still amounted to 10 receptions for 152 yards and two touchdowns through two games, more than acceptable from a fantasy perspective. Brown will look to keep the momentum going at the expense of the Rams in a Week 3 interconference home matchup next Sunday.",

    "report": "Kupp brought in five of six targets for 81 yards, adding two carries for 19 yards in the Rams' 37-19 win over the Eagles on Sunday.Kupp improved on his 40-yard performance from Week 1, going for 100 total yards and leading the team in targets, receptions and receiving yards in the process. He still hasn't found the end zone in 2020, but Kupp should continue to see a healthy amount of targets moving forward as one of the top options in the Rams' passing attack. His upside may be diminished compared to 2019, as Jared Goff is on pace for far fewer than the 626 passes he attempted a year ago.",

That's partly the byproduct of offensive coordinator Joe Brady looking for different  ways to get the ball in the talented Samuel's hands, but it also stemmed from Christian McCaffrey's early exit due to an ankle injury. The fact the third-year pro has been only a minimal subject of quarterback Teddy Bridgewater's attention through their first pair of games together has to be disappointing to fantasy managers, however, and Samuel will look to up his involvement in the passing game in a Week 3 inter-conference road tilt against the Chargers.",

Snead has a catch of at least 20 yards in each game as well. While Snead is effective in his role, it's not a role that adds up to much volume. He ranks fourth on the team in target share, and Baltimore has attempted a league-low 50 passes as a team. Snead and the Ravens will take on the Chiefs in Week 3.",

Before being sidelined with an ankle injury Weeks 14 through 17, Humphries averaged a shade over three catches and 31 receiving yards per game during 2019. Humphries already has 11 receptions and 95 combined receiving yards on the young season, and he's one score away from tying his touchdown total from all of last year. The 27-year-old wideout is set up well going into Week 3, facing a matchup against a Vikings defense that has surrendered 578 passing yards through its first two outings of 2020.",

    "report": "Amendola caught two of seven targets for 21 yards during Sunday's 42-21 loss to Green Bay.With Kenny Golladay (hamstring) again out of commission, Amendola saw more targets than his career per-game average. However, outside of a solid, chain-moving catch on third-and-10, Amendola didn't make nearly as big of an impact as he did in the season opener, though Matthew Stafford did blow a chance to hit a wide-open Amendola down the right sideline at one point. It seems Golladay has a chance to return Week 3 against the Cardinals, which may be a net positive for Amendola even if it costs him a downturn in targets.",

Minnesota's passing game couldn't get on track as Kirk Cousins struggled with a 15.9 NFL passer rating, so it's hard to read too much into Johnson's performance. Johnson still is ahead of Jefferson on the depth chart, but it seems only a matter of time before the 2020 first-round draft pick passes him for a more prominent role.",

    "headlineNews": "Chargers' Mike Williams: Does little in Week 2",
    "report": "Williams recorded two receptions on four targets for 14 yards in a 23-20 overtime loss to the Chiefs on Sunday.It was a lackluster outing for Williams, particularly after re-asserting his deep-game prowess in the Week 1 win over the Bengals. That's in large part thanks to a game script that emphasized getting 2020 No. 6 overall pick Justin Herbert comfortable in his first career start, with Keenan Allen (seven catches for 96 yards) and Hunter Henry (six for 83 yards) racking up most of the team's passing yardage. It's still a bit troubling Williams only received four targets in a game where the Chargers attempted 33 passes, especially considering Herbert's deep ball should in theory aid Williams much more than that of nominal starter Tyrod Taylor.",

    "report": "Ford brought in seven of nine targets for 76 yards in the Dolphins' 31-28 loss to the Bills on Sunday.Despite the fact DeVante Parker was able to play through a questionable designation due to a hamstring injury, Ford still played a major role as the No. 3 receiver. The third-year pro ultimately checked in second in receptions, receiving yardage and targets on the Dolphins to tight end Mike Gesicki, meaning he set the pace for the wideouts. Ford only logged four targets in Week 1, but in a Chan Gailey-coordinated offense that has traditionally generated solid production for what were previously complementary receivers, he may have some upside. Ford won't have to wait long to try and build on Sunday's numbers as the Dolphins will take on the Jaguars in a Week 3 road battle Thursday night.",

Although he was able to put together a solid fantasy performance last week when the team was playing from behind, this week's game script allowed the Bears to play conservatively, giving Miller little chance to be successful. Unless he begins to see an elevated snap count, he'll likely be a volatile fantasy option with a dangerously low floor.",

He got the Chiefs on the board with a 10-yard touchdown catch in the second quarter, giving him two scores in as many games to start the season. The star tight end also has 140 yards and 15 receptions to his name already, so he should remain locked into fantasy lineups despite a seemingly difficult matchup against the Ravens next Monday night.",

The veteran tight end didn't receive another target for the rest of the game. It was a costly mistake, but Olsen still logged 71 percent of the offensive snaps -- higher than Week 1's 66 percent. He'll continue to be the No. 1 TE in Seattle moving forward, but his fantasy value may be touchdown-dependent.",

The second of those plays was a 20-yard TD catch from backup QB Jeff Driskel, and Fant immediately followed it up with a catch on the two-point conversion to get Denver within three points of Pittsburgh. After a disappointing conclusion to 2019 in which he only picked up four or more receptions once over his final six appearances, Fant is red hot to kick off 2020. He now draws a matchup against a Buccaneers defense that hasn't allowed a tight end touchdown since Week 11 of last season (tied for the longest active streak in the NFL).",

    "report": "Gronkowski failed to bring in his only target in the Buccaneers' 31-17 win over the Panthers on Sunday.The multi-time Pro Bowler has not looked the part  over the first two games of his NFL return after a one-year sabbatical. Gronk's legendary rapport with future Hall of Fame quarterback Tom Brady has yet to materialize; in fact, the tight end was the intended target Sunday on Brady's lone interception. Gronkowski's fantasy dud was made all the more galling by the fact receiver Chris Godwin (concussion) was sidelined for the contest, which could have seemingly set up the former for a significant boost in opportunity. Gronkowski will look to put his forgettable 2020 start behind him when the Buccaneers clash with the Broncos in a Week 3 interconference road battle.",

Of even greater concern is the fact that Dallas Goedert has seen eight targets in each game for 111 yards so far in 2020. Ertz has a good chance to rebound in a Week 3 matchup against the Bengals, but Goedert's emergence will likely be something to watch all season.",

Smith's return to the field Thursday, in any capacity, would support that notion and put him on track to serve as Tennessee's top tight end Sunday against the Vikings.",

However, the third-year tight end began to pick up steam in the second half of last season, and Sunday, he single-handedly dispelled the notion that tight ends are doomed to minimal roles in coordinator Chan Gailey's scheme. Gesicki paced Miami in receptions, receiving yards and targets, and his one score came with 49 seconds remaining to bring the Dolphins within three points. It remains to be seen if Gesicki's stellar performance is an outlier, but he'll have a chance to quickly follow it up in a Week 3 road matchup against the Jaguars on Thursday night.",

    "report": "Eifert caught three of six targets for 36 yards and one touchdown during Sunday's loss to the Titans.The Jaguars didn't have any standout performances from pass catchers Sunday as QB Gardner Minshew spread the love and completed at least three passes to eight different receivers. Eifert was targeted only once in the season opener but was much more involved Week 2, as was fellow tight end James O'Shaughnessy (four catches for 40 yards). Neither player is a primary option in the passing game and both are unlikely to provide much week-to-week consistency.",

While the tight end used his body well to make that grab, Cook didn't haul in another pass until the Saints' final drive of the game. At that point, the team's struggles without Michael Thomas in the passing game were pronounced, with Tre'Quan Smith the only one to really capitalize on his absence outside of the always-involved Alvin Kamara. On the bright side, Cook has now reached 80 yards or scored a touchdown in both games thus far, offering encouragement ahead of Week 3's matchup against the Packers.",

On a day Bridgewater finished with 367 passing yards, Thomas' complete lack of involvement comes as a concern. The tight end will be desperate to make a larger impact in Week 3 versus the Chargers, but Sunday's goose egg sets the bar incredibly low.",

Now with Uzomah out, Sample has been thrust into a prominent role as a check-down option for Joe Burrow beginning with a matchup against the Eagles, which just gave up three touchdowns to the Rams' Tyler Higbee last week.",

Sunday against Dallas, he was heavily involved in the game plan from the jump, as Matt Ryan took a deep shot to Hurst on his second pass attempt of the game before connecting with the tight end on a 42-yard completion two drives later. By the end of the contest, Hurst had finished one yard shy of his career high in receiving (73 yards) from 28 games with the Ravens. Week 3 presents a matchup against a Bears defense that's already surrendered 13 catches, 120 receiving yards and one touchdown to opposing tight ends on the year.",

    "headlineNews": "Lions' T.J. Hockenson: Catches every pass sent his way",
    "report": "Hockenson caught four of four targets for 62 yards during Sunday's 42-21 loss to the Packers.The absences of Kenny Golladay (hamstring) and Halapoulivaati Vaitai (foot) seem to have thrown a wrench in the Lions' offensive plans. While Hockenson has secured all nine of the passes sent his way through two weeks, he's only seen one target in the red zone, and his overall upside is likely capped as long as the Lions offense continues to struggle. If Golladay, in particular, remains out Week 3, expectations for Hockenson should remain capped despite a seemingly inviting matchup with the Cardinals. Even though the Arizona defense was notoriously poor at defending tight ends in 2019, the retooled unit has only allowed 11 receptions for 84 yards and no scores through two weeks.",

After scoring a touchdown Week 1, he finished second in targets behind Brandin Cooks in Week 2. He's caught all nine of his targets through two weeks while doubling the playing time of Darren Fells, who entered training camp as the presumptive No. 1 tight end and scored Houston's lone touchdown Sunday. That usage may be a function of the Texans playing from behind a lot, but Akins is emerging as a go-to option for quarterback Deshaun Watson.",

Barkley may be done for the year with a torn ACL, but Shepard's injury doesn't appear to be as serious. When Shepard returns, the two could battle for targets.",

He did well to toe the sideline and dive for the pylon for an 18-yard touchdown in the second quarter, then added a four-yard score just before halftime. Kittle's expected to return in Week 3 and push Reed back into a lesser role, but this performance shows that Reed's capable of stepping up should Kittle need to miss any additional time. Quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo exited at halftime with an ankle injury, and the entire 49ers' passing game will be tough to trust despite a favorable matchup against the Giants next week if Garoppolo can't go.",

    "report": "Izzo was on the field for 70 of the Patriots' 72 snaps on offense in Sunday's 35-30 loss to the Seahawks, Mike Reiss of ESPN.com reports.In the process, Izzo hauled in both of his targets for 19 yards.  Meanwhile, for the second straight week, Devin Asiasi recorded 10 snaps and zero targets, and fellow rookie Dalton Keene (neck) was inactive. Izzo remains the Patriots' most trusted tight end while the younger players at the position are worked in gradually, but he's not seeing enough volume in the team's passing game to merit fantasy attention in anything but the deepest of formats.",

    "report": "Schultz corralled nine of 10 targets for 88 yards and a touchdown, losing one fumble during Sunday's 40-39 win against the Falcons.Fantasy GMs in leagues large and small will be rushing to the waiver wire to add the 24-year-old tight end, as he may have secured a key role within Dallas' high-octane passing attack as result of Blake Jarwin's torn ACL. Schultz attracted just 19 combined targets across his first 27 NFL appearances between 2018 and 2019, but he has already garnered 14 in the early going of the new campaign. The slate toughens up somewhat in Week 3, as the Cowboys take on a Seahawks defense that permitted just three catches and 38 receiving yards to the tight end position in its season opener.",

While it's still possible Doyle makes it back for Week 3, he'll likely need to practice on at least a limited basis Thursday or Friday to have a realistic shot at playing against New York. While filling in for Doyle in the win over Minnesota, Mo Alie-Cox had a breakout game with over 100 receiving yards, a performance that could lead the Colts to play it safe with their top tight end until he's fully healthy.",

    "report": "Dissly (Achilles) was a limited participant in Wednesday's practice, Michael-Shawn Dugar of The Athletic reports.This is Dissly's first appearance on the injury report since being fully cleared for Week 1. It's slightly concerning considering he ruptured his Achilles tendon Week 6 last year, as the injury could be flaring up despite successful rehab. He'll likely be closely monitored as a result. If Dissly is forced to miss any time, Greg Olsen would get a slight bump as the clear No. 1 TE, but the Seahawks could opt to use less two TE sets, meaning WRs David Moore and Freddie Swain could benefit as well.",

The 24-year-old tight end should play a larger role in Week 3 against the Colts given the lack of healthy pass catchers left in the Jets offense.",

Rudolph did start slow last season (one target in four of the first five games) before rebounding, so there's some reason for optimism.",

That never really materialized for any one player, including Howard, who actually saw his targets halved from his Week 1 tally. The fourth-year tight end will look to get back on track in Week 3 against the Broncos on the road, irrespective of whether Godwin is available for that contest.",

    "headlineNews": "Giants' Kaden Smith: Minimal involvement Week 2",
    "report": "Smith caught two of three targets for a net loss of one yard during Sunday's 17-13 loss to the Bears.After corralling both of his targets in the season opener for a total of 17 receiving yards, Smith served as little more than a bail-out option for his sophomore signal-caller Daniel Jones. At his peak, Smith racked up 267 yards and three touchdowns between Weeks 12 and 17 last year, but with Evan Engram now back in the fold after missing the latter half of 2019 due to a foot injury, the 23-year-old Smith has attracted a mere five targets in two games. Smith and the Giants will see a 49ers defense in Week 3 that is without the services of Nick Bosa (knee), Richard Sherman (calf), and Solomon Thomas (knee), though as a whole San Francisco has conceded the second-fewest tight end receptions in the NFL to this point.",

    "report": "Alie-Cox caught five of six targets for 111 yards during Sunday's 28-11 win over the Vikings.Alie-Cox stepped in for Jack Doyle (ankle) and led the team in receiving yards by a comfortable margin. He had the team's longest gain of the day -- a beautiful 33-yard reception -- and tied for the team lead in targtes. Alie-Cox's performance should earn him a role in the offense once Doyle is healthy enough to return, but with many other mouths to feed in the Colts offense, he shouldn't command an abundance of targets every week. His next outing will come Sunday against the Jets.",

    "report": "O'Shaughnessy caught all four of his targets for 40 yards in Sunday's 33-30 loss to the Titans.The 28-year-old and starter Tyler Eifert combined for only two targets in the season opener, and they mirrored each other's workload again in Week 2 (three catches for 36 yards), though Eifert also had a touchdown. The pair are splitting playing time early on this season, and unless O'Shaughnessy ends up claiming a significantly larger role, he's unlikely to be fantasy relevant.",

He then got open in the end zone just minutes into the second quarter before capping off his day with a 28-yard scamper down the left sideline where he went in untouched for the hat trick before waving and bowing to the empty stadium. After a huge finish to the 2019 season, it seems Higbee has carried momentum into 2020, settling in as a top-three option in the Rams' passing game.",
