    "report": "",
    "analysis": "In a game that earned the \"heavyweight fight\" moniker the hard way, Allen set a new career high for pass attempts by nine. With his pass catchers continually crumpling from cramps in the grueling Miami heat, Allen was lucky to escape with zero interceptions. Without exaggerating, he threw 5-6 interceptable balls. He also fumbled three times, losing one. Playing behind an offensive line that was literally down to its last man, Allen took four sacks and had the Dolphins' line in his face nearly every play, especially after the break. Allen's scores went to Devin Singletary and Isaiah McKenzie, though he could have had more. Gabe Davis committed a drop in the end zone, while Allen had McKenzie for a go-ahead touchdown with 1:49 remaining. Instead, he turfed it and was disconsolate after the fact. It was just one of those days, one that was still an elite effort despite the miscues. Allen did bang his throwing hand late. He required X-rays after the game but was able to play through the issue on Buffalo's final drive. He told the assembled media he was \"fine\" ahead of next week's road date with the Ravens.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

Brissett is looking better than expected as Deshaun Watson's placeholder, but big plays remain few and far between. He will never be a priority streamer, including Week 4 against the Falcons.\u00a0\n",

Hurts overcame early struggles -- he completed just one of his first six throws -- to carve up a banged-up Washington coverage unit. He connected with Smith, A.J. Brown, and Dallas Goedert for touchdowns. Improved accuracy and greater confidence as a passer has made Hurts a fantasy world beater through three weeks. He'll be a high-end QB1 play in Week 4 against the Jaguars.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Through Sunday's games, Rodgers have the lowest air yards per attempt in the league. Green Bay's conservative, check-down offense was on full display against Tampa, as Rodgers threw short to Robert Tonyan, his running backs, and Randall Cobb over and over. Rodgers keyed in on Romeo Doubs early and often; Doubs led the team with eight targets and 73 yards. Rodgers played intelligently throughout a defensive slug-fest between the Packers and Bucs, an emerging theme in an offense without Davante Adams. Probably 10-team fantasy managers can do better than Rodgers in Week 4 against the Patriots. In 12-team format, he'll be a high-end QB2 option.\u00a0\n",

Goff played well enough for the Lions to win the game, but Dan Campbell got conservative in the fourth quarter. He opted to not to go for it on 4th-and-4, which would have been a game-sealing conversion. The Lions instead attempted and missed a 54-yard kick. Even if made, the kick would have only put the Lions up six. The miss gave the Vikings great field position for their subsequent game-winning TD drive. Goff will look to get the Lions back to .500 against the Seahawks in Week 4.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Mariota also lost a fumble. Mariota maximized his limited attempts by finding each of Kyle Pitts, Drake London, Olamide Zaccheaus and Anthony Firkser for 20-plus yard completions. For his rushing score, he found the edge then lunged for a one-yard touchdown. For the aerial strike, London did most of the work after the catch. Mariota's interception was a poor decision as time was winding down at the end of the first half. Not the best, but not a killer. With rushing scores in 2-of-3 contests, Mariota is displaying enough of a dual threat to have some QB2 appeal. The Browns are on tap for Week 4.\u00a0\n",

After his first two drives ended in punts, Lawrence and the offense wouldn't leave the field without putting points on the board or taking a knee for the remainder of the game. Out from under the tyranny of Urban Meyer, Lawrence has looked like a different quarterback to start the year. He ranks as a high-end QB2 for Week 4.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Herbert entered Sunday as highly questionable because of the fractured cartilage in his ribs. He made a few shaky throws throughout the day but had the highlight of the week with a dime to Jalen Guyton. Herbert made nailed the 54-yard shot while running to his right and throwing across his body. The interception, thrown in the second quarter, bounced off the hands of Sony Michel before making its way to a defender. Herbert wasn't hobbled by the injury and made it through the game, so things could have been far worse. He will attempt to rebound versus the Texans in Week 4.\n",

Osborn for a 28-yard reception, the first 20+ yard play of the day for Minnesota, which got the Vikings to the Lions' 28. On the very next play, he hit Osborn for another 28-yard reception, this time for the game-winning TD. Cousins also found Adam Thielen in the back of the end zone for a one-yard TD earlier in the game.

One too-high Smith attempt sent Tyler Lockett to the blue tent. Thankfully, the wideout was able to return. As has been something of an early-season theme, Smith was decent before the break then considerably less so after. Just 107 of his yards came in the second half as he was forced into more predictable passing situations. Smith's awareness and arm drive just aren't what you want to see out of a legitimate NFL starter. We don't doubt that he's a better option than Drew Lock, but that is the definition of damning with faint praise. Smith is not a compelling streamer for Week 4 against the Lions even though it could be a high-scoring environment.\u00a0\n",

He's historically dissected Colts DC Gus Bradley's defenses from their time together in the AFC West, but Mahomes tossed a three-yard touchdown to Travis Kelce in the first quarter and then never visited the end zone again. Kelce should've had a second score in the fourth quarter but dropped the back-shoulder throw. Mahomes got the ball back with less than a minute to play and hit Marquez Valdes-Scantling for a chunk gain but tossed a game-ending pick while targeting JuJu Smith-Schuster on the next play. Mahomes gets a tough Week 4 road date with the Bucs in Tampa Bay.\n",

Wentz and the Commanders never seemed particularly interested in moving the ball or scoring points; the team all but gave up shortly before halftime against a vastly superior opponent. Wentz should be considered a matchup-based fantasy option who should be able to get by on garbage time in a pass-first Commanders offense. He'll be a serviceable streaming option in Week 4 against Dallas.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Jackson continued his hot start to the season with another big performance against the Patriots. Jackson's first touchdown pass on the day came on a six-yard strike to Mark Andrews, who later connected with Jackson for a 16-yard score in the second quarter. That was just the beginning for Jackson, who would throw two more scores to Josh Oliver and Devin Duvernay in the third quarter, in what was a back-and-forth game. Late in the fourth quarter, Jackson would put the team on his back to secure the win. On Baltimore's final scoring drive, Jackson found Rashod Bateman for a 35-yard gain and ripped off a 20-yard rushing before scoring a nine-yard touchdown to put the game out of reach. Still in search of a new contract, Jackson's new deal with the Ravens will break the bank if this type of play continues throughout the season. The 2019 NFL MVP has throw for 749 yards, 10 touchdowns and two interceptions while adding another 26-143-2 on the ground. The Ravens play host to the Bills in Week 4.\n",

    "analysis": "Joe Flacco, who leads the NFL with 165 drop backs and 155 pass attempts, will take a seat after filling in for the injured Wilson. The Jets generally played at a slower pace and with a focus on a more balanced offense when Wilson started 13 games in 2021. He was among the NFL's least accurate passers, with Jets pass catchers seeing a marked drop in opportunity and production with Wilson under center. All Jets running backs, receivers, and tight ends should get a slight downgrade with Flacco once again holding the clipboard. Wilson is only usable in superflex formats.\u00a0\n",

With the game on the line in the fourth quarter, Trubisky oversaw three straight three-and-outs. His deep ball had no zip. With 10 days between now and Week 4 against the Jets, it would be the perfect time for the Steelers to make the move to Kenny Pickett, but there has thus far been zero indication they are considering it.

He also showcased rough accuracy on many of his third-down throws. Nevertheless, he was able to scramble out and create on third-and-10 with 8:16 left in the game and find Kendall Hinton for 27 yards, and scamper forward for 12 more yards on third-and-6 later in the drive. Eventually the Broncos finally found the end zone to take a slim lead -- one of few Broncos drives that ended without boos from the home crowd -- and held on for dear life. The Broncos travel to Vegas to face a desperate 0-3 Raiders team in Week 4, and desperate also probably describes the state of Russ' fantasy prospects.\n",

    "analysis": "All he does is win, as Rush is now 3-0 under center as the Cowboys' starter with Dak Prescott sidelined the last two seasons. Rush just doesn't make mistakes and knows where to go with the football. The offensive line gave him all the time in the world to throw in this one, and Rush's touchdown was a beautiful end-zone fade to CeeDee Lamb where Lamb made a sick one-handed catch for the score. Rush has completed 65.6% of his passes the last two weeks at 7.4 yards per attempt. Prescott is expected to remain sidelined for Week 4 against the Commanders. Rush is still a bottom-barrel fantasy option.\n",

A red zone pick that was a late throw to Brandin Cooks was tipped and popped up. Then, in a tied fourth-quarter game deep in his own end, a checkdown target to Rex Burkhead on third-and-1 was tipped at the line and picked off by Roquan Smith, gifting the Bears free reign to run the clock out and kick a winning field goal. Mills managed some deeper throws in this game as the Bears seemed to focus most of their coverage on Cooks and lose other receivers at times. All-and-all, nothing he's done this year suggests he's an answer, but the Texans don't have a lot to lose by throwing him out there again in Week 4 against the Chargers.\n",

Micah Parsons gave Giants first-round RT Evan Neal his \"welcome to the NFL\" moment under the bright lights of primetime. Jones didn't play as bad as the stat line would suggest, but he also looked to, at times, be seeing ghosts in the pocket. That kind of pressure will do that to a quarterback, as Jones has been pressured more than any other passer through three weeks. Jones' interception came on the final play when David Sills fell down on his route. Jones isn't a reliable fantasy option but does get a favorable Week 4 draw at home with the Bears.\n",

The team came out flat in the second half, which allowed the Raiders room to mount an impressive comeback - ultimately falling a two-point conversion short in the final minutes of the game. 15 of Tannehill's 27 pass attempts were directed at Robert Woods and Derrick Henry in\u00a0 an offensive game plan that was largely biased towards the short areas of the field. It was a step in the right direction for the now 1-2 Titans as they gear up for an AFC South divisional matchup with the 1-1-1 Colts in Week 4.\u00a0\n",

It didn't look much better from there. The 49ers were bottled up by Denver clamping down on Deebo Samuel and George Kittle, and Garoppolo's lone touchdown pass was immediately decried on TV as offensive pass interference that created an easy path for Brandon Aiyuk to get in the end zone. Left to try to field a comeback down a single point, Garoppolo was picked off once and nearly took a second sack in his own end zone before a Jeff Wilson fumble ended up. Things don't get any easier for Garoppolo's banged up offensive line in Week 4, as the 49ers travel to meet Aaron Donald and the Rams. Garoppolo will be a fringe QB2.\u00a0\n",

The Rams own the Cardinals under coach Sean McVay, and Murray always seems to struggle against them. Murray's pass-catchers also didn't help him by dropping between 5-10 catchable balls.

    "analysis": "He caught all four of his targets for 45 additional yards in the passing game, pushing Barkley's total yards to 126 for the night. The lone highlight was a Barkley-esque 36-yard touchdown run in the third quarter to give the Giants a 13-6 lead. They quickly relinquished the lead and never found it again. Prior to the touchdown scamper where he broke multiple tackles on his way to the end zone, Barkley had been bottled up for 39 yards on 11 carries. He continues to look like the only capable player in this offense. Barkley gets a dream Week 4 matchup at home against the lowly Bears, who also somehow have a fluky 2-1 record.\n",

    "analysis": "Robinson's day was made by a 50-yard rushing touchdown on a fourth-and-one from midfield. He got the start over Travis Etienne and had a strong lead over him until the final drive when Etienne cleaned things up versus a battered LA defensive line. Etienne ended the day with 13 carries for 45 yards. Robinson is the top back in this committee and is trusted on passing downs, giving him a strong shot at returning RB2 numbers any given week. He will look to repeat the performance when he faces the Eagles next week.\n",

It was a disappointing outcome against a Philly defense that had given up the league's highest EPA per rush coming into Week 3. As usual, Gibson was not involved in the Commanders' passing offense while J.D. McKissic caught six of his nine targets for 32 yards. Gibson's time as Washington's primary ball carrier could be coming to an end with the return of Brian Robinson (lower body) as soon as Week 5. Gibson should get one more game in his current role next week against the Cowboys. He should be treated as a no-ceiling RB3.\u00a0\n",

The contest had been over for more than a quarter, but the starters inexplicably remained on the field until the final whistle. After three weeks, Ekeler is averaging 27 rushing yards per game. His floor has been boosted by weekly average of seven catches, but the ceiling hasn't been there. He has also given up goal line work to other backs, further hurting his upside. He will look to bounce back as a solid RB1 bet versus the Texans.\n",

What's more important, is that in the Jets' comeback effort, Hall saw more passing work than Carter. It was believed that Carter was the team's main pass-catching back, but it was Hall who saw 11 targets. Could we be seeing a changing of the guard? It still seems to be a 50/50 split between the two which should keep both as solid flex plays.\u00a0\n",

Williams more-or-less alternated plays with Melvin Gordon despite looking more explosive, which will come as a surprise to nobody who has paid attention to Broncos football over the last year and three games. A juicy matchup against a Raiders team that allowed Derrick Henry to get his groove back is on tap for Week 4.\u00a0\n",

Tony Pollard still out-shined him with a 13/105 rushing output, but he's not going away and was still involved at the goal line earlier in the game. The Cowboys are deploying a true timeshare out of the backfield. Elliott and Pollard saw one target apiece, with Elliott catching his for two yards, though he still has negative receiving yards on the year. Elliott will be a TD-or-bust RB2 next week against the Commanders.\n",

Harris has at least managed to reach 18 handles each of the past two weeks. The workloads aren't the problem so much as Harris' supporting cast. Although it was better tonight, the offensive line remains a liability. Mitch Trubisky, meanwhile, is threatening precisely nobody under center. Harris will nevertheless remain on the RB1/2 borderline for his plus Week 4 matchup with the Jets.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

The Cowboys are deploying a true timeshare with Pollard and Ezekiel Elliott, and it was Elliott who found the end zone in this one, punching in a one-yard score on his way to 15/73/1 on the ground. Pollard's long run went for 46 yards, and he's averaging over 6.7 YPC the last two weeks. Pollard will be an RB2/3 next week against the Commanders.\n",

The Titans offensive line largely held their own, routinely leading to more yards before contact than Henry has seen to this point in the season.

That is despite the fact that he received carries from the Steelers' three- and one-yard lines in the fourth quarter this evening. He couldn't convert, and Nick Chubb came in to finish the job one play later. Hunt will continue operating as a solid RB2/FLEX in this run-based offense, but Chubb ensures his spiked weeks will be few and far between.\u00a0\n",

Unquestionably the most versatile back in the Patriots' backfield, it was only a matter of time before Stevenson would have his first strong fantasy performance of the season. His receiving upside provides a safer floor than that of the touchdown-dependent Harris, but he's still a low-end RB2 in a backfield that remains fairly split on opportunities.\n",

    "analysis": "The Chiefs, per Teicher, \"still don't seem comfortable using Clyde Edwards-Helaire in most third-down situations,\" instead using pass-catching specialist Jerick McKinnon, especially in the team's two-minute offense. McKinnon in Week 3 against the Colts ran more routes and equaled CEH with seven rushing attempts. After three games, it's McKinnon who leads the Kansas City backfield with a 28 percent snap share while Edwards-Helaire sits at 27 percent. CEH has skated by with four touchdowns through three weeks -- a pace that won't continue. There won't be much fantasy juice to squeeze out of the KC backfield unless CEH or McKinnon miss time. NBC Sports' Edge's Denny Carter recently recommended McKinnon as a waiver add in 12-team leagues.\u00a0\n",

Wilson's 37-yard carry in the first quarter set up the lone 49ers touchdown of the game, and he had an 18-yard carry that got the 49ers into Denver territory before a Garoppolo sack quickly ended the drive. While he's still a good back, San Francisco's offensive line situation is starting to look dire and that could ratchet down his fantasy value. He's best-approached as a low-end RB2 in Week 4's game against the Rams.\u00a0\n",

The Saints' lost this game by five, so the touchdown could have been the difference between a win and a loss. Jameis Winston struggled in this game and that is reflected in Kamara's receiving line. He was targeted seven times but only came away with two catches. Mark Ingram also stole a carry at the five-yard line that he punched into the end zone. With two dissapointing weeks under his belt, Kamara will look to rebound versus the Vikings.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Akers wasn't even heard from him in the first half, rushing two times for -1 yards before the break while seeing zero targets, but the Rams chose to feed him in the second half as they attempted to kill the clock. In total, Akers out-carried Darrell Henderson 12-4, and Henderson saw the only target between the two. Akers scored from 14 yards out in the third quarter and had a goal-line look in the fourth but lost a fumble at the one-yard line. Averaging 5.1 YPC Sunday, this is the most we've seen from Akers since his torn Achilles in the 2021 offseason. Akers looks like the Rams' preferred ball-carrier headed into a Week 4 date with the 49ers where he'll be an RB2/3.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Penny remained mired in a three-man committee, though he did handle 14-of-21 running back carries. He comfortably out-snapped Ken Walker and DeeJay Dallas. Would-be third-down back Travis Homer departed early with a rib injury. Penny's 14 carries were a new season high, but it's still not enough for the noted \"rhythm\" back. There has been little indication coach Pete Carroll will consider a different deployment moving forward, making Penny a rather-uninspiring FLEX despite his 10-12 carry floor.\u00a0\n",

Under unrelenting pressure, Josh Allen was forced to check down time and again. The Bills also dominated time of possession, running 90 plays to the Dolphins' 39. That's a staggering differential. This kind of usage will not be a common occurrence for Singletary, especially since Zack Moss and James Cook both remained involved this afternoon. Singletary continues to operate as a fine FLEX option but does not seem to be graduating to RB2 status despite the elite nature of his offense. Baltimore is on tap for Week 4.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Diggs also drew a red zone personal foul on Xavien Howard. Mired in grueling Miami heat and humidity, Diggs spent much of the second half shuttling in and out of the game with cramps. He still managed to tie for the team lead in targets, though looks were plentiful on an afternoon where the Bills ran 90 plays and Josh Allen attempted a career-high 63 passes. Despite today's quieter affair, Diggs has now reached at least seven receptions in all three of his 2022 appearances. He is cooking with PPR gas. Another potential shootout for Week 4 awaits in the Ravens.\u00a0\n",

It went right through his hands and was a pass he catches 99% of the time. Lamb was able to redeem himself in the fourth quarter, taking over a drive, making a tough catch on fourth down to extend it, and then finishing it off with a one-handed one-yard touchdown on a fade to the corner. Lamb's 12 targets were five more than Noah Brown, and Lamb has now seen target counts of 11, 11, and 12 to open the year. Rush is also doing a great job of keeping him afloat in fantasy with Dak Prescott (thumb) sidelined. He's gone 7/75 and 8/87/1 with Rush the last two weeks. Lamb will be a WR2 for Week 4 against the Commanders.\n",

Sometimes, that means he won't put up the explosive numbers we saw in Week 2,\"\u00a0Louis-Jacques said, adding that Hill's 33-yard game against the Bills should be seen as an \"outlier.\" Waddle in Week 3 against Buffalo posted 102 yards on four catches in a low-volume outing for Miami's offense. Waddle has seen 31 percent of the team's targets through three weeks while Hill has a 30 percent targets share. Surprisingly, Waddle leads the Dolphins with a 41 percent air yards share. If defenses continue focusing on shutting down Hill, Waddle has a good chance of outscoring Hill in 2022.\u00a0\n",

He is the first Browns pass catcher with back-to-back 100-yard games since Josh Gordon in 2013, while it is the first time he personally has breached the century mark in back-to-back weeks since 2016. Stunning. Jacoby Brissett has accomplished what Derek Carr and Dak Prescott could not. It helps that Cooper has almost no other target competition to speak of, though David Njoku had something to say about that this evening. Cooper also had a pair of bad drops, including one on third down in the fourth quarter. That is just Cooper being Cooper. He will be a solid WR2 for Week 4 against the Falcons.\u00a0\n",

It was Smith who nearly got Lockett killed on Sunday, throwing a hospital ball that sent him to the blue tent. Thankfully, Lockett missed only a handful of reps. Lockett will be a higher-end WR3 for next week's potentially higher-scoring date with the Lions in Detroit.\u00a0\n",

    "headlineNews": "Deebo Samuel caught 5-of-8 targets for 73 yards in San Francisco's Week 3 loss to Denver, adding five carries for six yards.\u00a0\n",
    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Deebo was open on wheel routes twice early in the game, once with his quarterback ignoring him, and another time with his quarterback hanging up the ball so long that it likely cost him at least 20 extra receiving yards. Samuel also took a pounding in the middle of the field in the second quarter when he was stood up by the defense and pushed around in a pile by both sides -- he briefly left the game over this. Samuel's last target was a ball thrown wildly behind him by Garoppolo. He's still a lock-and-load WR2 vs. the Rams in Week 4, but he'll need more from his quarterback to play up to his standard.\n",

Hollins would ultimately score on the drive to bring the Raiders within a two-point conversion to tie the game with under two minutes to play, but the Derek Carr pass attempt fell short and the Titans were able to run out the clock. Hollins appears to be a weekly WR3 with upside having played at least 87% of the offensive snaps in each game thus far.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Guyton's snaps were down considerably this season, keeping him well off the fantasy radar. However, his injury is a loss for the Chargers offense because Guyton provided a downfield speed element that wide receivers Josh Palmer and DeAndre Carter don't bring to the table. Mike Williams could end up running additional deep routes as a result of Guyton's absence, which would not be ideal with Justin Herbert playing through a ribs injury. It's possible the Chargers sign a wide receiver to play a rotational deep threat role.\u00a0\n",

The rookie was Winston's favorite target throughout the game and could be even more involved going forward. Both Jarvis Landy and Michael Thomas went down with injuries in this game. The statuses of those players will play a role in Olave's Week 4 outlook, but he should be treated as a WR3 no matter who is in the lineup.\n",

    "analysis": "Johnson also committed his customary drop, with this one costing the Steelers a major third-down conversion in the fourth quarter. Earlier in the proceedings, he tacked on five yards by drawing a defensive holding call. It was soon after that that Johnson expressed visible frustration with Mitchell Trubisky's ball placement. With Mitch at the controls, Johnson has zero scores in three games and is averaging 9.3 yards per reception. That is not going to cut it, though Johnson has kept his PPR value afloat with at least six grabs each time out. That's nice, but Johnson might need a quarterback switch to Kenny Pickett to re-establish high-end WR2 upside.\u00a0\n",

Carr squeezed a pass through double coverage to Adams on a five-yard touchdown pass in the second quarter, but most of Adams' day was spent running sprints against two defenders. It seems teams are simply content to dedicate additional attention to Adams until Carr and the Raiders show they can connect elsewhere. Adams will look to get back on track in a Week 4 divisional showdown against the Broncos in Las Vegas.\n",

    "headlineNews": "Robert Woods caught 4-of-9 targets for 85 yards in the Titans' Week 3 victory over the Raiders.\n",
    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Woods did most of his damage in the first half, shaking free for multiple chunk gains down the sideline. His largest play came against tight coverage along the sideline, where he broke free from Roc Ya-Sin for a gain of 41 yards. Derrick Henry would punch the ball in two plays later to send the Titans up 14-3. Pass volume dried up in the second half for the entire offense, but the Raiders never threatened until late in the fourth quarter. Fantasy managers can rest easy seeing Woods more than double his yearly target total in Week 3. Woods could find more room over the intermediate areas of the field against the prevent defense of the Indianapolis Colts in Week 4.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "It was the second most productive game of McKenzie's career from a catches, yards and targets perspective. For his eight-yard touchdown in the second quarter, he was left uncovered out of the slot as the defense keyed in on Stefon Diggs. He should have had a second score, but Josh Allen turfed a gimme touchdown in the waning moments of the game. McKenzie was then targeted on the contest's literal final play but could not get out of bounds to stop the clock. Some may say he made a poor read back toward the middle of the field. It was still a plus effort, one where McKenzie highlighted his unusually-fast acceleration. He will have some low-end WR4 appeal for Week 4 vs. the Ravens.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Brown's seven targets were second on the team to CeeDee Lamb's 12 while Lamb turned his into an 8/87/1 line. With Michael Gallup (knee) still out, Brown continued to operate as the clear No. 2 receiver. Gallup, however, is due back next week against the Commanders, though Brown's strong play and the Cowboys winning games might allow the team to ease Gallup's return. Brown would be tough to trust in fantasy if Gallup does play.\n",

Barring a practice setback, Allen should return to LA's lineup in Week 4 against the Texans. Perhaps Allen, who had four catches for 66 yards in the first half of the team's Week 1 game before hurting his hammy, can provide a spark for the down-bad Chargers offense. After running 30 percent of his pass routes from the slot over the past three games, Josh Palmer will probably be bumped to the outside with Allen's return. Palmer is barely a WR3 with Allen back in the fold.\u00a0\n",

Evans shoved Lattimore to the ground on Sunday, triggering an all-out brawl between the two sides after Tom Brady started the conflict while jawing with New Orleans defenders in an ugly offensive game. With Evans out for Week 3 against the Packers, Breshad Perriman -- who ran a route on 77 percent of the team's drop backs and caught three balls for 45 yards and a TD in Week 2 -- should see a full complement of snaps. He's worth a pick up in all 12-team formats.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Shepard went down in a heap on the final play of New York's Monday night loss to the Cowboys. He was carted off and later diagnosed with another season-ending injury. Shepard's absence from the Giants offense will open up plenty of targets for the team's remaining receivers, including Richie James, who has functioned as the team's WR2 in the early going. Kadarius Toney, if he can come back from a hamstring issue and earn the trust of Giants coaches, could slot in as the team's new top wideout with Shepard sidelined.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Doubs led the team with eight catches for 73 yards and a touchdown in a Week 3 win over the Bucs. He ran a route on 94 percent of Aaron Rodgers' drop backs, and drew praise from Rodgers after the game. The team drew up a range of plays specifically for the rookie, who had three receptions in the game's opening drive. Doubs certainly looked the part of Green Bay's best, most explosive wideout against Tampa. If his increased snap share and route share hold in Week 4 against the Patriots, Doubs can be treated as a high-end WR3 with plenty of upside. For more on Doubs, read Denny Carter's Week 4 waiver wire breakdown.\u00a0\n",

He led the team in receiving yards and was second in targets behind Curtis Samuel (10). McLaurin, the Commanders' only real deep threat, came down with a pretty 45-yards reception in double coverage on Carson Wentz's best throw of the day. We'd like to see McLaurin see more intermediate targets to go along with the downfield opportunities. We won't complain though. He should be fine as a WR2 option in Week 4 against the Cowboys.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Andrews was targeted early and often in this one, with his best drive coming on the Ravens' second possession of the game. On that drive, Andrews caught four passes for 39 yards, capping the drive with a five-yard score to give the Ravens their first touchdown of the afternoon. Andrews would score on a 16-yard touchdown in the second quarter, accounting for two of Lamar Jackson's four passing touchdowns on the afternoon. Andrews has now caught 22 passes for 245 yards and three touchdowns on the season. Arguably the best fantasy tight end in the game, he could be in for another big game next week against the Bills.\n",

A week after running a route on 63 percent of Cleveland's drop backs against the Jets, Njoku in Week 3 had a strong 87.5 percent route participation. Unfortunately for Njoku drafters, Stefanski and the Browns value Njoku as a run and pass blocker. His production could seesaw all season if the opponent's coverage truly determines how he's used.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Pitts' eight targets led the team, while his 87 yards more than doubled his previous season total. After protesting earlier in the week that he could not just force Pitts targets, coach Arthur Smith did just that on the Falcons' opening drive, looking his way four times. One of the looks was erased by a defensive holding call that Pitts drew in the end zone to help set up a touchdown. Pitts used stiff arms and some shoulder lowering to tack on extra yardage. You could argue this still isn't enough usage, but Marcus Mariota did attempt just 20 throws with Atlanta riding the running game. Pitts will remain in the top five at tight end for Week 4 against the Browns.\u00a0\n",

His second and final reception came one minute later. With Mitchell Trubisky struggling to generate offense and sustain drives, Freiermuth had zero targets before the final frame. Freiermuth will offer decent weekly touchdown odds and will have the occasional 6-7 catch effort, but Trubisky is severely capping his upside.\u00a0Even for plus matchups like Week 4 against the Jets, Freiermuth is best treated as a back-end TE1.\u00a0\n",

Kittle managed just one first down, but looked spry and played fast coming off missing the first two weeks with a groin injury. If Williams' injury is serious, the 49ers could spend more time with Kittle chipping, which would limit his overall fantasy upside. But we all know he's still a TE1 in season long leagues even if that happens.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Wilcox (6'4/247) certainly doesn't lack for experience as he made 38 starts across 49 appearances in South Florida's power run offense, finishing as the program's all-time leader in catches (100), receiving yards (1,326) and receiving touchdowns (11) by a tight end. He tends to separate against man coverage with subtle push-offs and appears fearless when running over the middle of the field, but his lack of concentration (10 dropped the past two seasons) needs improvement. His toughness isn't in question as he ultimately recorded his best receiving line (43/540/2) in 2018 while playing through multiple nagging ankle injuries. Wilcox's strength will hinder him at the next level, but his consistently great effort will be sufficient (and coveted) on special teams.\n",

    "analysis": "Fantasy football's No. 2 kicker in 2020 is cashing in on a profoundly efficient season in which he made 36 of 39 field goal attempts, banging through all 36 of his extra point tries. He established himself as one of the league's big-footed kickers by nailing eight of nine kickers over 50 yards. Sanders' extension includes a $10 million guarantee. His 2020 numbers stand in stark contrast to his 2019 stats, which include seven missed field goals on 30 attempts. Only the Cowboys and Falcons attempted more field goals than Miami in 2020, giving Sanders the opportunity necessary to become a waiver wire darling in fantasy. Sanders will probably be one of the most over-drafted kickers in fantasy football next season.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Brkic (6'3/201) was one of the Lou Groza Award finalists in 2021 as well as an All-Big 12 second-team selection. He held a field goal accuracy rate of 76.9% in both the 2020 and 2021 seasons, achieving 100% back in 2019 when he was successful on 17-of-17 attempts. He made every one of his extra-point attempts in 2019 and 2020, missing just one PAT in 2021 (57-of-58). One of the brightest moments of Brkic's career came when he tied an FBS single-game record with three field goal makes of at least 50 yards (51, 56, and 55) along with a 26-yard make in the season opener vs. Tulane. He will push Greg Joseph, who is due a non-guaranteed RFA tender amount of $2.433 million.\u00a0\n",

It flies through the uprights, accurate.\" If you're a fantasy football traditionalist, York could make for an interesting selection in fantasy drafts.

Santos is not called on very often from 50-plus yards, making him an extra unlikely recipient of this kind of contract. There's a chance this deal could quickly become an albatross.\u00a0\n",

Koo is now the league's second-highest paid kicker at $4.85 million per year, trailing only Justin Tucker at $5 million. Koo bounced around the league a bit with the Chargers and Patriots before settling in with the Falcons in 2019. He's been dynamite in Atlanta, drilling 92.6% of his field goals, going 87-of-94 in three years, and 95.1% of his extra points in that span. He's also 13-of-14 on field goals of 50-plus yards. Koo deserves the pay day.\n",

His hit rate on extra points has never dipped below 89 percent. Boswell's accuracy while kicking for a capable offense makes him one of the best fantasy options at the position every year, and 2022 is no different.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Apparently the team was less than thrilled with their all-world kicker not joining his teammates in the locker room during halftime of the Super Bowl. TV cameras showed McPherson, 22, staying on the Bengals benched taking in a show by legendary hip-hop artists. \"Though the stunt still isn\u2019t sitting well with Simmons, it eventually will fade into the background of McPherson\u2019s overall body of work, which stands as one of the greatest seasons by a kicker in Bengals history, and one of the best by a rookie in league annals,\" The Athletic's Jay Morrison said. Simmons added that McPherson would need to improve his kickoffs this offseason. McPherson finished his rookie year with the ninth most field goals (29) and the ninth most attempts (34), drilling five walk-off kicks. No one recorded more field goals of more than 50 yards in 2021. His clutch postseason kicks and cockiness made McPherson something of a household name. He'll likely be the first kicker off draft boards in 2022.\u00a0\n",

After starting for the Browns in 2021, McLaughlin was eventually released after the team drafted Cade York out of LSU in the 2022 draft. He then lost the preseason kicker battle in Indianapolis to recently released kicker Rodrigo Blankenship but gets a fresh start with the recent transaction.\u00a0McLaughlin struggled in 2021 with the Browns, missing 6-of-10 field goal attempts between 40-49 yards. Consider\u00a0McLaughlin nothing more than a low end streaming option in deep leagues that still include kickers.\n",

Tucker has certainly earned the highest-paid-kicker status after a decade of clutch kicking in Baltimore. The big-footed Tucker, who last year set the league record with a 66-yard bomb at the buzzer against the Lions in Week 3, has drilled 91.1 percent of his 358 field goal tries since entering the league in 2012. He's made a mind-boggling 72.8 percent of his kicks beyond 50 yards. Last year, he made all six of his attempts from outside 50 yards. Though the Ravens' red zone aggressiveness sometimes limits Tucker's opportunities, he should be the first kicker off draft boards in 2022.\u00a0\n",

He made all 12 of his field goal attempts and all ten of his extra points after stints in Carolina, Houston, and San Francisco during the 2021 season. In his first two NFL seasons, he made a middling 79.4 percent of his field goal tries. Slye, who has never missed arm day, has long been excellent on kickoffs. Perhaps Slye, 26, can find a long-term home with the Commanders.\u00a0\n",

His practice participation has been nearly flawless the last two weeks. But he's apparently still not ready. Frank Reich said \"But obviously the player's the one who's got to play. And only he truly knows how it feels. So, we watch tape and we can see when you look at tape from last year or the year before versus tape now, and you watch him move, we're doing that. And it's not the same. We need it to look the same. From our standpoint, we need that tape to look like what it looked like when you were relatively healthy.\". The middle-of-the-field Chiefs options and backs get a boost with Leonard still sidelined.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Smith didn't practice all week, but the Bears are still playing him. Meanwhile, CB Jaylon Johnson (quad), a surprise DNP on Friday is out. Also inactive for the Bears are WR Velus Jones (hamstring), S Dane Cruikshank (hamstring), TE Ryan Griffin (Achilles), LB Matt Adams (hamstring), and OL Ja'Tyre Carter. The only interesting name here from a fantasy perspective is Jones, who hasn't played in any of the first three contests of the season and has barely practiced with a long-term hamstring injury.\u00a0\n",
