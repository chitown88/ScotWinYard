Wilson also threw his first interception of the season in the second quarter, and Marcus Peters ran it back 67 yards for a touchdown.

Despite having not logged any extended regular-season action since 2017, Moore proved capable in his initial work as a replacement for Mahomes, completing 10 of 19 attempts for 117 yards and a touchdown. With Mahomes likely to miss around three weeks of action in a best-case scenario, the Chiefs could promote undrafted rookie Kyle Shurmur from the practice squad and/or add another quarterback to the roster via free agency or trade, but Moore should get the first crack at filling in as the team's starting quarterback. While Moore is directing the offense, expect coach Andy Reid to rely more heavily on the ground game than he has in previous weeks.",

Given that significant volume, Rivers is a viable quarterback to turn to even given his inconsistent efficiency. On the other hand, he will draw a tough matchup in Week 8 as the Chargers will take on the Bears.",

The veteran quarterback then brought the Miami sidelines to life by capping off an 11-play, 60-yard fourth-quarter drive with a gutsy 11-yard scoring scramble that he finished by lowering his shoulder to get into the end zone. Fitzpatrick was reinstated as the starter mid-week after coach Brian Flores backtracked from an earlier statement that Josh Rosen would keep the top job, and given Fitzpatrick's performance Sunday, he's certainly poised to helm the passing attack again in a Week 8 Monday night matchup versus the Steelers.",

        "analysis": "Shortly after the Redskins' 9-0 loss to the 49ers on Sunday, Callahan indicated that Keenum would retain the starting gig in Week 8 with Washington facing a quick turnaround for its Thursday night matchup with Minnesota. After following up with the media Monday, Callahan now seems to have extended Keenum's leash at least two more games, though an ugly showing versus the Vikings could lead the coach to re-evaluate things. Keenum has completed 66 percent of his pass attempts and owns a 9:4 TD:INT in six appearances, but he's only thrown for four touchdowns over his past four starts and was already pulled from the starting job once in favor of Colt McCoy. At this point, McCoy probably isn't a realistic threat to jump Keenum in the pecking order, but first-round pick Dwayne Haskins should receive another look at some point once the Redskins are convinced the rookie is up to the task.",

Behind an injured offensive line as well, the tailback was still able to rip off a game-long run of 19 yards, allowing him to actually post his best rushing total since joining the Jets. Monday also marked the first time Bell topped 4.0 yards per carry this season. While his numbers admittedly came in a blowout, and he's now finished with merely one catch in back-to-back games, Bell can at least take some personal pride from his performance. In Week 8, he'll face a Jaguars defense that's allowed 4.8 yards per rush so far this season, ranking eighth-worst league-wide.",

In doing so, he doubled his touchdown total on the year, with his six TDs now matching the amount he managed as a rookie. With at least 15 carries in all but one game this season, Michel has been a consistent presence on non-passing downs, and he next faces a Browns defense currently surrendering the third-most rushing yards per game (154.0).",

While he has clearly been the team's top back over Austin Ekeler since returning in Week 5 against Denver, Gordon has averaged just 2.25 yards per carry.

Consequently, Johnson finished with just one carry for two yards while playing three of 39 offensive snaps in the first half, per Weinfuss. Meanwhile, Edmonds ran roughshod over the Giants en route to 27 carries for 126 yards and three touchdowns while gathering in two of four passes for 24 yards. Considering how effective he was, it'll be interesting to see the breakdown of reps between Edmonds and Johnson once the latter gets healthy.",

However, he amassed 20 carries for the third time in his last four games, providing him with volume to cover up his lack of efficiency. His most impactful run came late in the fourth quarter, when he scored on an 11-yard run for what turned out to be the game-winning score. Henry will clearly remain an integral part of the Titans' offense with Ryan Tannehill under center, though his lack of involvement in the passing game will cap his potential upside. In addition, Henry will draw a tough matchup against the Buccaneers' stout run defense in Week 8.",

Averaging 2.6 yards per carry looks poor on paper, but the 24-year-old was constantly dealing with eight-man fronts against a defense that was (correctly) anticipating the run for the majority of the contest. Conner's ability to shed tackles actually led to a better final yardage mark than most backs would have been able to provide in this scenario. With the Steelers on bye in Week 7, Conner will now look to move past the physical issue in time for the team's Oct. 28 contest against the Dolphins.",

The Redskins listed Peterson as a non-participant in Monday's estimated practice report, and it would be surprising if he managed anything more than limited activity in Tuesday's session. Even though he's banged up, Peterson said Tuesday his ankle is \"night and day\" compared to how he felt a day earlier, leaving him optimistic he'll be good to go by the time Thursday arrives, per Tom Pelissero of NFL Network.",

That culminated in Sunday's 29-touch outing, which nearly tripled his past career high in usage.

        "analysis": "White was his usual self Monday, making plays primarily as a pass-catcher out of New England's backfield. In fact, White led the Patriots in receiving yards, and would have finished with even more if not for a shoestring tackle on a would-be touchdown during the second half. Although he again contributed nothing on the ground, White has now caught at least six passes in four straight games, garnering at least eight looks in all of those outings. That evidences his consistent role ahead of Week 8's meeting with the Browns.",

        "analysis": "With the Rams having built a 24-point lead by the third quarter and Todd Gurley working his first game back from a quadriceps injury, the third-round rookie back found himself in line for a career-high workload of 12 offensive touches. Though his overall game line does not necessarily reflect as such, Henderson showed impressive burst with the opportunities granted, picking up six or more yards on two of his second-half carries. In Week 8, he and the Rams' backfield will face a Cincinnati defense that conceded more than 215 team rushing yards to Jacksonville on Sunday.",

        "analysis": "You'd have to go back to Week 1 of the 2014 season for the last time Fitzgerald was held to a single catch. There wasn't much going wrong Sunday, rather the Cardinals were content dinking and dunking and running the ball while their defense swarmed fellow rookie Daniel Jones. Fitzgerald has otherwise had somewhat of a renaissance with Kyler Murray throwing him passes with at least five catches in each of his first six games. He'll likely be counted on more next Sunday against a tough Saints defense.",

Tate looks like a great fit for Pat Shurmur's quick-strike offense and a solid security blanket for his rookie quarterback. Tate has been targeted 26 times in his three games in blue and is averaging 13.0 yard per catch, which would represent his highest for a season since 2014. Next up is a return to Detroit against his former team.",

He at least trailed only Demaryius Thomas' nine targets among his teammates, showing that Darnold will consistently look his way no matter the circumstances. After a nightmare matchup in the wake of his 125-yard, one-touchdown explosion in Week 6, Anderson will look to get back on track against the Jaguars this Sunday.",

The wideout said he altered his blocking strategy because of the official's call the previous play. \"I'm trying to not block like I can block because of the rule changes and because I felt like I did nothing wrong on the blindside block that they called on me,\" Landry said. \"So I tried to take a charge and pretty much hurt myself.\" Landry finished out the game, playing 96 percent of the offensive snaps, so the injury appears to be minor. He added that the ankle will be fine because he has the bye week to recover.",

Despite playing about half the snaps the last two weeks because of the head injury -- he left early in Week 6 and was seemingly on a pitch count in Week 7 -- Allison has averaged six targets per game in the three contests Davante Adams (toe) has missed. However, that volume has resulted in just nine receptions, 101 yards and no scores. Allison is getting his opportunities right now, but with Adams due back at some point, and fellow wideouts Jake Kumerow and Allen Lazard pushing for more snaps, he could eventually see fewer chances if his output does not increase.",

During his first three games of the season, of which Jones played twice and saw extended snaps once, Engram averaged 7.7 receptions per game and 12.0 yards per reception. In his three games since, all with Jones, he's averaged 3.7 receptions per game for 9.3 yards per reception. Whether Engram is able to round back into early-season form will be worth watching, but Detroit's top-flight pass defense will be a tough opponent against which to do it in Week 8.",

The recent emergence of fellow tight end Dallas Goedert (four receptions, 69 yards and a touchdown) could frustrate Ertz's fantasy owners, but Sunday's role reversal should be written off as an anomaly, as the latter is still the top dog heading into a matchup against the Bills on Sunday.",

Zach Ertz remains the top tight end in this passing attack, but coach Doug Pederson may be trending toward more formations with two tight ends to aid a wide receiving corps that has taken a beating this season.
