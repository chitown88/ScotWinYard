The veteran quarterback once again honed in on a very tight circle of pass catchers, with 11 of his completions going to Courtland Sutton and Emmanuel Sanders and another four to running back Royce Freeman. Flacco has now gone back-to-back games without a touchdown pass and has just a 6:5 TD:INT on the campaign. He'll look to make much more of an impact than in the last two games when the Broncos face the Colts in a Week 8 matchup, a week from Sunday.",

Minshew has regressed to the mean after a red-hot start to the season, completing less than 60 percent of his passes in three consecutive games after establishing a 73.9 percent completion rate between Weeks 1 and 3. His 9:2 TD:INT ratio is impressive, but the rookie signal-caller entered Sunday tied with Kyle Allen for an NFL-worst four lost fumbles. That is one aspect that Minshew will need to clean up in order to give the 2-4 Jaguars a chance to creep back into the playoff mix. In Week 7, he and the Jacksonville passing attack will be opposing a Bengals defense that has allowed 235-plus passing yards in five straight outings.",

The veteran quarterback had his connection with Stefon Diggs working on all cylinders in the first half, hitting the speedy receiver for scoring throws of 62 and 51 yards in the second quarter. He made it a trifecta when he connected with Diggs again in the third quarter from 11 yards out to extend the Vikings' lead after Philadelphia had closed to within 24-20. Cousins now boasts a 6:1 TD:INT over his last pair of contests and will look to stay hot in a divisional showdown against the Lions in Week 7.",

He played his second turnover-free game of the season and his passing output was in line with his season average. This excellent rushing performance puts Jackson on pace for over 1,200 yards on the ground this season, putting him in elite company among quarterbacks, and his ability to limit turnovers while contributing through the air makes him quite valuable from a fantasy perspective.

The fourth-year quarterback also got his completion percentage over 60.0 percent for the first time since the opening contest of the campaign, and he did so while notching four completions of at least 20 yards to four different pass catchers. Wentz and the Eagles are back down to .500 with Sunday's loss, and they'll look to log their fourth win of the season in an NFC East showdown versus the Cowboys in Week 7.",

He also rushed twice for eight yardsJones and the Giants put up a valiant fight for three quarters, but ultimately, they fell by multiple touchdowns to the defending champs like the majority of teams seem to. The rookie's first two interceptions came in the first half in his own territory, with the second eventually leading to a Patriots touchdown. However, the third pick short-circuited New York's first drive of the second half at New England's 30-yard line, with Stephen Gilmore snagging a pass intended for Rhett Ellison. Jones was naturally hamstrung by the absences of Sterling Shepard (concussion), Evan Engram (knee), Saquon Barkley (ankle) and Wayne Gallman (concussion), which left him significantly short on weapons. Jones has now thrown six interceptions over his last three starts after a spectacular debut against the Buccaneers in Week 3, a trend he'll look to reverse against the Cardinals in Week 7 a week from Sunday.",

As a result, the veteran was able to pile up statistics playing catch-up, but it took until seven minutes left in the fourth quarter for Rivers to toss his first touchdown, ultimately connecting with tight end Hunter Henry on two consecutive drives in the end zone to make the score closer than the game ultimately was. Things won't get much easier for Rivers next week, as the Chargers travel to face a Titans defense that's allowing just over 15 points per contest.",

Fantasy owners likely aren't happy either, as the quarterback had two potential passing touchdowns that rookie tight end T.J. Hockenson failed to convert into scores. It'll be tough for Stafford to rebound at home in Week 7 against a Vikings defense that has allowed the sixth-fewest yards per pass attempt (6.4) in 2019.",

        "report": "Barkley (ankle) said Thursday that there's \"no doubt\" in his mind he can handle a full workload Sunday versus the Cardinals, Darryl Slater of The Newark Star-Ledger reports.Barkley's comments were made after he managed another full practice Thursday, his second in as many days. Despite the positive development, the Giants still may give him a game-day designation upon the release of Friday's injury report. Barkley aside, the Giants' backfield seems to be getting healthier, as Wayne Gallman practiced fully Thursday as he works his way through the concussion protocol. Ultimately, Barkley's workload this weekend may be contingent on which of the team's running backs are active.",

However, he only exceeded a four-yard gain on three of his 20 carries and was held to a sub-4.0 yard-per-carry average for just the second time this season as New Orleans' battle-tested front seven snapped his streak. What's encouraging is that Fournette has averaged 24 carries per game over the past three weeks after logging fewer than 15 attempts per game Weeks 1 through 3. The receiving upside, too, is an asset for Fournette, as he has four-plus receptions in every game but one thus far in 2019, heading into a Week 7 matchup against a Bengals defense that surrendered nearly 270 team rushing yards to Baltimore on Sunday.",

With the winless Dolphins clearly setting up for the 2020 season and beyond, it might be wise for them to deal the running back and accumulate another asset in the form of a draft pick. The team has already had trade conversations with potential suitors, and Drake has expressed openness to being moved.",

Not only did the 23-year-old suit up, but he shouldered a heavy workload and played a big role in controlling the ball (37:15 time of possession) in an unlikely victory over the (no longer) undefeated Chiefs. Jacoby Brissett vultured Mack's only potential touchdown, but fantasy owners will find it hard to complain about nearly 150 total yards from scrimmage. The third-year back is picking up where he left off following last season's breakout campaign, as he now has 470 rushing yards (4.7 YPC) and two scores through five games. Mack's ankle will get even more time to heal up during the Colts' upcoming bye week before he faces the Texans in Week 7.",

Not only did he cough the ball up on Green Bay's second offensive series, but he then dropped a wide-open, 33-yard touchdown on the next one. After that blunder, he gave way to Jamaal Williams, who capped that drive with a five-yard TD catch. While Jones would re-enter the game and produce decent results, it was Williams who wound up stealing the show, finishing with 14 rushes for 104 yards and four catches for 32 yards and the aforementioned touchdown. On the back of a disappointing display by his standards, Jones will aim for improvement in Week 7 versus the Raiders, but it wouldn't be surprising if the second-string Williams earns himself some extra touches following Monday's success.",

        "report": "Ekeler carried the ball five times for 14 yards and also caught three of his four targets for 14 yards in the 24-17 loss Sunday to the Steelers.An early 14-0 deficit essentially forced the Chargers to abandon the run, as Ekeler and Melvin Gordon combined to receive just 13 carries. Still, it was a bit of a surprise to see the third-year back receive just four targets one week after recording a team-high 16 in a similar game script. It's clear the return of Gordon has essentially relegated Ekeler to his primary backup role, with the shifty running back attempting just eight carries over the last two weeks compared to 56 in Weeks 1-4. That hasn't meant a significant loss in playing time however, as the 24-year-old is still seeing close to 65 percent of the offensive snaps each week, but the lack of carries likely hinders the type of upside fantasy owners might have hoped for after such an impressive start to the season.",

As was the case in 2018, Peterson will likely be subjected to a lighter practice load than most of his healthy teammates the rest of the season, but there shouldn't be any overriding concern about his availability for game days. Though Peterson enjoyed his best game of the season in the Week 6 win over the Dolphins (136 total yards on 25 touches), he'll likely have difficulty replicating that success with three straight matchups versus tough defenses on tap (San Francisco, MInnesota and Buffalo).",

The rookie has seen fewer opportunities on the ground than backfield mate Jordan Howard, but he clearly carries more big-play potential overall. Whether that will translate to more rushing touches in a Week 7 divisional battle against the Cowboys remains to be seen, but Sanders has now broken the ice in terms of touchdowns, as Sunday's trip to the end zone was his first as a pro.",

The 22-year-old actually led all Colts receivers in yardage on a night where the team was focused on moving the chains and controlling the ball. Mack will receive an extra week to return to full strength over the team's upcoming bye, so expect Hines to be limited to work on passing downs in Week 7's matchup against the Texans.",

In comparison, Jones finished with 11 carries for 47 yards and four catches on seven targets for 13 more. Given that discrepancy, Williams could very well earn himself additional touches in Week 7 versus the Raiders, but considering Jones still ranks second league-wide with eight touchdowns and is usually rather reliable, Williams' extra work should still come in a second-string capacity.",

Although he failed to haul in a catchable pass on his first target, Lazard immediately bounced back, corralling an unbelievable 35-yard touchdown pass from Aaron Rodgers on the very next play, cutting the Packers' fourth-quarter deficit to two points in the process. After that contribution, Rodgers looked for Lazard three times on the team's final drive, which ultimately helped set up the game-winning field goal. Although the injuries to his fellow wideouts will be important to monitor ahead of Week 7's game versus the Raiders, Lazard surely earned himself some extra snaps with his improbable performance Monday.",

He also rushed once for no gain.Thielen saw fellow wideout Stefon Diggs put together the spectacular numbers Sunday, but he still generated a solid fantasy line overall courtesy of a six-yard touchdown grab to open the scoring midway through the first quarter. Thielen checked in second to Diggs in receptions, receiving yardage and targets, and he's now scored three touchdowns overall over his last pair of contests. Thielen will look to make strong contributions once again in a Week 7 NFC North battle against the Lions.",

I'm not sore. I just have to take my time,\" Green said Thursday. \"If I can go, I can go. If I can't, I can't. It's no big thing. Like I said from day one, if I'm healthy enough to play then I'm going to play. Right now, I still have a little ways to go.\" Given that the team only practices once more this week, Green seems to be trending toward another absence, with added clarity on that topic due to arrive Friday, upon the release of the Bengals' final Week 7 injury report.",

Prior to Sunday's dud, the 29-year-old had been putting up strong fantasy numbers with 20 receptions, 195 yards and four touchdowns in three games (he missed Week 4 due to injury). Indianapolis' upcoming bye week will give Hilton's hamstring some extra time to get back to full strength, and the talented wideout should be a solid play in a favorable home matchup against the Texans in Week 7.",

Just as important, albeit not as spectacular, was Diggs' 11-yard scoring grab late in the third quarter, which extended Minnesota's lead to 31-20 at the time. The targets, yardage and touchdown tally were all high-water marks on the season for Diggs, who also equaled the season-best seven receptions he'd managed Week 4 against the Bears.

Jones, who was traded to Oakland from the Bills last week, projects to play reserve snaps alongside Marcell Ateman. Of course, if Jones is able to make the most of his limited opportunities against Green Bay, it's conceivable that the 2017 second-round pick could earn a larger offensive role going forward.",

He did receive one red-zone target on a third-quarter drive that culminated in a Devonta Freeman touchdown, but what did him in for an unproductive fantasy day was an output of just three catches -- his lowest total in that category since Week 14 of last season. Next up is a matchup against a Rams defense that held Jimmy Garoppolo and the 49ers to zero touchdown passes in its last game but, prior to that, gave up a combined 653 passing yards and eight touchdowns to the Buccaneers and Seahawks between Weeks 4 and 5.",

The yardage represents a season high for the 23-year-old wideout, highlighting a disappointing start to his sophomore campaign. Pettis continues to start on a weekly basis, but the 49ers' zone-run scheme has left few scraps to be had in the passing game outside of the team's starting tight end. Pettis should be viewed as a low-end option even in a favorable matchup against the Redskins on Sunday.",

This translated into a tough outing for Jones and it didn't help that he seemingly was the victim of an uncalled pass interference penalty on a deep pass down the left sideline. Not only that, but there seemed to be other times when he got open only for Matthew Stafford to force a pass in to Golladay. Clearly nothing more than the second fiddle among Lions receivers, Jones isn't a safe bet for a rebound performance in Week 7 against a Vikings defense allowing the sixth-fewest yards per pass attempt (6.4) in 2019.",

Beasley only has one red-zone look all season, something that probably won't change with tight end Dawson Knox emerging in recent weeks and the large, athletic Duke Williams breaking into the game plan against the Titans.

The absence of Marquise Brown (ankle) had little impact on usage for the veteran, who had received five targets in two of the previous three games and averaged 53 yards per game over that stretch. Snead is far from a bankable fantasy option seemingly regardless of who's in the lineup, and this should remain the case in next week's away matchup with the Seahawks.",

        "report": "Hooper caught all eight of his targets, logging 117 receiving yards and one touchdown during Sunday's 34-33 loss to Arizona.As far as the tight end position goes, it's hard to beat Hooper's immense workload of 8.3 targets per game. What's even better is that Hooper is converting those opportunities into decisive fantasy performances, with six-plus catches and 55 yards in every game but one so far this season, as well as three touchdown catches over the past four weeks. He was able to dissect a Cardinals defense that entered Sunday allowing an NFL-high 461 receiving yards and six touchdowns to the position, and in Week 7, he will face a Rams defense against which George Kittle amassed eight receptions for 103 yards Sunday.",

The starting tight end was making his return to the field after a four-game absence due to a tibia plateau fracture to his left knee. Henry was the primary beneficiary of a spirited fourth-quarter rally, catching three passes, including two touchdowns, in the fourth quarter. With the Steelers' defense hell-bent on stopping Keenan Allen, both Henry and Mike Williams received the largest target volume as the two combined for 19 targets, although most of that production occurred in the second half as the Chargers tried to erase a three-score deficit. While Henry isn't likely to benefit from that level of garbage-time production moving forward, the 6-foot-5 tight end clearly will be a major red-zone weapon moving forward.",

The five catches and 57 yards were actually season highs for the veteran tight end, and Witten's fantasy ceiling remains limited unless he's able to find the end zone.",

The QB looked his way again downfield three plays later, a ball the rookie tight end never picked up and which bounced off his back and into the arms of a defender. Fant was not targeted again for the rest of the game and drew some ire on social media, but the pass was thrown behind him and Flacco complimented the rookie after the game for beating his man and getting open. Fant has similarly drawn praise from other teammates and coaches, but has yet to put things together. He doesn't have much time to improve with the Chiefs coming to town Thursday.",

        "report": "Doyle caught all three of his targets for 19 total yards during Sunday's 19-13 win over the Chiefs.The Colts' pass targets took a back seat to the running game Sunday as Indy sought to control the pace of play and keep the Chiefs' offense off the field. Doyle's numbers were minimally affected, which tells you a lot about how the season has gone for the seventh-year tight end. He has reached 25 yards receiving just once this season, but the path of least resistance in Week 7, Indianapolis' first game off the bye, may be through the air: The Texans feature a solid run defense but leaky pass defense.",

Not only did Hockenson fail to extend a goal-line screen pass to the end zone early on, but he later dropped another potential touchdown in the corner of the end zone, failing to hang onto the ball after he hit the ground.

After Dissly exited the contest early, Willson played a season-high 56 offensive snaps and caught two of three targets for 16 yards.

Griffin has led an uninspiring group of Jets tight ends through the first five games, but his role figures to shrink once Chris Herndon (hamstring) is ready to join the lineup.",
