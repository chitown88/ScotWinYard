The Cowboys' offensive struggles aren't entirely on Dak's shoulders, but his play has certainly fallen off over the past month. His 6.1 yards per attempt over that stretch ranks 20th among quarterbacks and is well short of his 8.2 yards per attempt during the season's first ten weeks. He's managed multiple touchdown passes in just one of his past five outings. The floundering Dallas offense has been bailed out time and again by the team's elite defense. That doesn't matter to fantasy managers. Dak drafters probably won't find a better waiver wire option in Week 16, when Dallas plays the Football Team.\u00a0\n",

While solid, Herbert's night could have been something else entirely had his pass catchers not dropped at least four touchdowns.

Astoundingly, the Chargers got inside the Chiefs' five-yard line and came away with zero points three different times. That is how you lose a ballgame to the twice-defending AFC champions. As usual, Herbert wowed the internet with 1-2 absolute laser beams, including his fourth quarter touchdown strike to Keenan Allen in a maze of traffic. Playing at a near-MVP level, Herbert has a fantasy semifinals smash spot in the Texans.\u00a0\n",

Rodgers and the Packers took full advantage of a pass-funnel Baltimore defense that has been ripped by recent opponents. Rodgers spread the ball around in this one: Davante Adams saw a mere seven targets, tied for the team lead with Marques Valdes-Scantling. This was the first time Rodgers failed to eclipse 300 yards since Week 10, and it was the tenth time in 12 games he's thrown for multiple touchdowns. As per usual, Rodgers will be a high-end QB1 in Week 16 against the Browns.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Murray and the Cardinals were asleep throughout their humiliating loss to the Lions, out-hustled and outplayed throughout. Murray was yanked in the blowout loss with four minutes to go in the fourth quarter. Under duress from start to finish against a middling Detroit front seven, Murray missed a handful of makable throws. The Cardinals drove deep into Detroit territory a few times in the first half and came away with a single field goal. Murray avoided taking off from the pocket time and again, instead scrambling behind the line of scrimmage and hoping Arizona wideouts could get open. They did not. Murray, after a red-hot start to 2021, has accounted for one touchdown over the team's past two games and has multiple touchdown passes in just one of his past four outings. Hopefully he can get it together next week against the Colts, though it might not matter for Kyler drafters who were likely done in by their QB's lackluster Week 15 performance.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "The seventh 400-yard game of Mahomes' career was his second of the season, with this one representing his new 2021 high-water mark. Mahomes relied on his old faithfuls of Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce, finding his top-two weapons for an otherworldly 22/339/3. That included some jaw-dropping after-the-catch work from Kelce and hard-to-believe grabs from Hill. They bailed out their quarterback on a night where he made some seriously shaky throws, none shakier than his interception to LB Uchenna Nwosu inside his own 10-yard line in the fourth quarter. Mahomes also turf missiled a walk-in touchdown to Mecole Hardman on a third quarter fourth down from the Chargers' two. That is to say nothing of the open pass catchers Mahomes was missing all night. It was after those second half mistakes, however, that Mahomes seemed to find himself, making huge plays with his legs and stick 'em throws with his arm. He now heads into a fantasy semifinals matchup with a collapsing Steelers defense, though Pittsburgh's struggles are particularly acute on the ground.\u00a0\n",

He was under pressure all evening long too and generally struggled to move the ball against a stingy Rams defense. Tyler Lockett's absence certainly didn't help either. Wilson's interception was a last-gasp effort to make up ground with under a minute remaining, so it's hard to put much blame on him for that one even if it's his most obvious box-score imperfection.

When he did throw, Garoppolo was nearly perfect. On top of completing 78 percent of his passes, Garoppolo didn't throw an interception or take a sack. Garoppolo's worst performances over the past seven games have been a 65-percent completion rate outing and one week at eight yards per pass on the dot. He has been dialed in for nearly two months and the only thing that has been able to hold him back is his team's run-first tendencies. While that could stop him versus the Titans, he'll clock in as a QB2 in Week 16.\n",

He was looking to hit Zay Jones on a deep shot but ultimately overthrew his receiver. Luckily for Carr, his defense got him the ball back with two minutes left and he marched the offense down the field, putting Daniel Carlson in position to net a game-winner. It wasn't Carr's greatest performance but his fourth-quarter drive was nothing but clutch. The Browns also did a good job of taking Hunter Renfrow away, forcing him to rely on Zay Jones and Foster Moreau. It was an ugly win versus a COVID-depleted Cleveland squad but Carr managed to keep his team in the playoff hunt. He projects as a middling-QB2 option versus a stingy Denver defense next week.\n",

    "analysis": "Ryan's struggles without Calvin Ridley continued this week. The 49ers even gifted Atlanta great starting field position to open the game by botching the kickoff at their own 14-yard line. The result of the ensuing drive was a goal line stand by the San Francisco defense. They stopped the Falcons' offense at the one-yard line four times to get the turnover on downs. Ryan is averaging 209 passing yards and less than one touchdown per game since Ridley stepped away from the team. With no update on the star receiver, we're left to assume things will continue to spiral for the Atlanta passing attack. If there is a light at the end of the tunnel, it's that the Falcons face the Lions next week. Ryan will slot in as a solid QB2 option versus one of the league's worst secondaries.\u00a0\n",

Wentz also sailed the ball over/behind Michael Pittman multiple times including on the team's first possession after Pittman ran himself open 40 yards downfield. If it were not for Jonathan Taylor (29/170/1) and New England's first six possessions (punt, blocked punt, punt, INT, INT, turnover on downs), Wentz would be ridiculed rather than pat on the head for simply falling forward for three first downs on 4th-and-short.

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Tannehill rushed five times for 18 yards and a one-yard touchdown but also lost a fumble on a botched snap. His touchdown sneak was the Titans' lone touchdown, but his two turnovers accounted for four of Tennessee's turnovers on the day. It was the difference, as Pittsburgh didn't turn the ball over a single time. It's a bad loss for the Titans, dropping them to 9-5 ahead of a Week 16 home date with the surging 49ers. Tannehill again lost Julio Jones (hamstring) to injury in this one, but A.J. Brown (chest) will be eligible to return from I.R. any time now. Tannehill has been nothing more than a middling fantasy QB2 all year.\n",

He compensated by finding each of DeVante Parker, Isaiah Ford, Mike Gesicki and Albert Wilson for a 20-plus yard gain, but Tagovailoa was struggling whenever his first read was covered. He needs Waddle back in the worst way for Week 16 against a Saints pass defense that has really come back down to earth in 2021. Despite that, Tagovailoa will not be a recommended streamer for the second week of the fantasy playoffs.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Hughes is objectively correct. The Jets have averaged 1.35 points per drive with Wilson under center and 2.19 points per drive with anyone else at the helm. Joe Flacco, for one, is a far superior option to Wilson, whose dismal play crushes fantasy value for everyone in the Jets offense. Hughes pointed out that Jets coaches said Wilson would be rejuvenated after a lengthy absence with a knee injury; he's been as bad or worse since returning to the lineup. Only Davis Mills has a worse Pro Football Focus passing grade than Wilson through Week 15. Hughes said Wilson's play over the season's final three games will prove crucial in luring free agents to the Jets this offseason. More disastrous play from Wilson could make the team a no-go for 2022 free agents.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "It wasn't the most high-octane performance from the Bills offense. Allen handed the ball off 23 times and seemed less inclined to rush the ball himself. The Bills even ran an Isaiah McKenzie wildcat play, which may have been a designed rush for Allen if the quarterback was dealing with a foot sprain. Allen looked good when dropping back. He hit Stefon Diggs for an 11 yard TD on play action. He then connected twice with Gabriel Davis, first in the back for the end zone on a beautiful 20-yard throw. He then found Davis wide open on a 4th-and-3 play action, which iced the game. Allen's interception game on a heady play by Jeremy Chin, who baited Allen into a throw to Diggs in zone coverage. Overall, it was a strong game from Allen, who was held back more by the Bills' playcalling than the Panthers' defense. He will be a locked-in QB1 in Week 16's rematch with the Patriots.\n",

Boyle was an interception-throwing vending machine in college and picked up right where he left off in this one while averaging a pitiful 3.3 yards per attempt. T.J. Hockenson accounted for 51 of Boyle's passing yards. Boyle is expected to get the Thanksgiving start against the Bears, but Detroit could reevaluate things after this performance.\n",

    "analysis": "Both of Jones' touchdowns came in the fourth quarter while trailing 20-3, which tells you exactly how the first three quarters went for New England. Even when the Patriots had momentum, connecting on consecutive passes on their first possession out of the half, Jones made an errant throw to Colts LB Bobby\u00a0Okereke for the rookie's second turnover of the evening. The Patriots opened the game with six failed possessions \u2014 punt, blocked punt, punt, INT, INT, turnover on downs \u2014 including a turnover inside the 10-yard line but did at least manage to make it competitive at the end thanks to Carson Wentz's fourth-quarter interception in between four defenders. Jones will look to bounce back in a crucial (and repeat) divisional matchup against the Bills in Week 16.\n",

Not counting his fourth quarter two-point conversion, CEH was also held without a goal-line or red zone touch as Darrel Williams and FB Michael Burton both handled two. He was the intended target on Patrick Mahomes' interception inside the 10-yard line, but the mistake was entirely the quarterback's. CEH's workloads have shrunk in back-to-back contests, and he is averaging just 14 touches in four games since returning from injury. All that being said, he will remain in the RB2 mix for Week 16 because the Chiefs will be facing a Steelers run defense in absolute free fall. Just consider him more of a floor than ceiling play.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "He \"added\" two catches for eight yards on five targets in the passing game. Just a brutal performance for the rookie and fantasy players in the opening week of the fantasy playoffs. The Steelers literally did nothing on offense, as the defense carried them to a win with four forced turnovers. Harris was stuffed on a goal-line plunge in the third quarter before Ben Roethlisberger QB-sneaked it in on the next play. Harris will look to rebound as an every-down RB1 next week at Kansas City.\n",

He reeled in both looks for five yards. As the between-the-tackles back for an offense that hasn't been able to put points on the board, Patterson's fantasy value is trending in the wrong direction. However, he gets a date with the Lions next week, giving him a chance to play the bulk of Week 16 with a lead. Even if his target volume stays reduced versus Detroit, the matchup should let him get there on the ground alone. Patterson can be trusted as an RB2 next week.\n",

Kamara was coming off a season-high 27 carries last week, so it's a reminder that Ingram's presence will continue to be a drain on his usage down the stretch. Kamara gets a Week 16 matchup with a Miami run defense that's been among the league's best.\n",

Taylor, who has now recorded 29 carries in three of his last four games, didn't receive a touch on the first drive but was\u00a0responsible for the lead crack-block that freed Nyheim Hines for his eight-yard score, eventually settling in for 18 first-half carries. With 1,518 rushing yards through Week 15, Taylor is firmly in the MVP discussion behind Tom Brady. He'll be needed in Indianapolis' polarizing upcoming matchup against the Cardinals.\n",

A Tremon Smith kickoff return touchdown kept the Jaguars distant enough to make it rough to establish the run, and Robinson had just 19 rushing yards after halftime. He also briefly left the game around the two-minute warning of the first half with what appeared to be a hit to his knee. With Carlos Hyde out, Robinson had a lockdown on the workload and returned a good performance. Week 16 against the Jets is as smash spot as it gets for a runner on this team.\u00a0\n",

Last week, Jones played a majority of the Packers' snaps for the first time since returning from the knee injury. The increase in workload bodes well for his odds of returning high-end RB2 numbers versus the Browns this week.\n",

We suppose that is something to cling to heading into a soft Week 16 matchup with the Jaguars, but running decently well before Carter's return, Coleman has probably now ensured he will maintain a role between the tackles. Carter will stay on the \"risky FLEX\" radar because of just how in the tank the Jags have gone despite some mid-season run stinginess.\u00a0\n",

Despite the Browns playing from behind for roughly three-quarters of this game, Cleveland ran the ball on 44 percent of their plays. Chubb also gave just one carry to his backups, who were primarily used on the two-minute drill and third downs. Playing without Kareem Hunt has afforded Chubb a massive rushing role. If Hunt is out for Week 16, Chubb should continue posting RB1 numbers versus the Packers.\n",

    "headlineNews": "Rashaad Penny rushed 11 times for 39 yards, adding five yards on two catches in the Seahawks' Week 15 loss to the Rams.\n",
    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Penny briefly went to the locker room with a back injury but quickly returned to the sideline. While he was gone, DeeJay Dallas rushed in a four-yard touchdown, so it was bad timing for Penny managers that he got hurt during an eventual scoring drive. Dallas actually finished with more rushing yards than Penny, but it was the former first-round pick who operated as the lead back when he was available on Tuesday. The Seahawks' backfield is a mess, and it'll get even messier once Alex Collins returns. Seahawks coach Pete Carroll said last week that Penny has earned a shot to lead the backfield, but it's difficult to trust any Seattle back right now. Penny is a flex option for Week 16 against the Bears.\n",

He's dominated backfield snaps of late -- relegating Matt Breida to spot duty -- while Zack Moss has been inactive for most of the past month. \"Singletary has put his ball-security issues to rest and shown a spark with some chunk plays when the Bills have needed it,\" Buscaglia noted. Against Carolina in Week 15, Singletary ran for 86 yards and a score on 22 rushing attempts. He led Buffalo backs with 27 pass routes, though he only saw one target. Fantasy managers can finally trust Singletary as a low-ceiling RB2 play. He gets the Patriots in Week 16.\u00a0\n",

    "headlineNews": "Dolphins co-offensive coordinator Eric Studesville said the team will continue with a running back competition in Week 16.\u00a0\n",
    "report": "",
    "analysis": "\"All those guys are going to play and participate in the game plan,\" Studesville said when asked about the team's game plan headed into Week 16 against the Saints. It's not exactly a surprise after Duke Johnson came off the team's practice squad and had the game of his pro career against the Jets in Week 15, rushing for 107 yard and two touchdowns in the Dolphins' victory. CBS commentators said during the Dolphins-Jets game that Miami coaches weren't sure Myles Gaskin could handle a full workload after coming off the COVID-19 list 24 hours before game time. Maybe we'll see his reps increase in Week 16 after seeing ten carries to Johnson's 22 attempts against New York. Both Miami backs are borderline flex options against the Saints since neither of them is likely to serve as a workhorse.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "The 14 touches were easily a new season high for Jackson after he also posted a new season high last Sunday with 10. Tonight's increased usage was a function of Austin Ekeler not being 100 percent with an ankle issue, though Ekeler still out-touched Jackson. J-Jax showed off his chunk-play ability with gains of 15, 13, eight, eight, 22 and 15 yards. He might be worth getting more involved down the stretch, but obviously not at the expense of Ekeler. Another 10-plus touches are likely in the cards for next week's blowout-script setup with the Texans.\u00a0\n",

The Cardinals got Edmonds involved early in the second half and he immediately ripped off a 23-yard run.

If Arizona continues to struggle, the Cards won't produce the sort of game script necessary for both backs to succeed. Edmonds -- who out-rushed Conner on fewer carries in Week 15 -- will be a fringe flex option in Week 16 against the Colts.\u00a0\n",

It's not exactly a surprise after Duke Johnson came off the team's practice squad and had the game of his pro career against the Jets in Week 15, rushing for 107 yard and two touchdowns in the Dolphins' victory. CBS commentators said during the Dolphins-Jets game that Miami coaches weren't sure Myles Gaskin could handle a full workload after coming off the COVID-19 list 24 hours before game time. Maybe we'll see his reps increase in Week 16 after seeing ten carries to Johnson's 22 attempts against New York. Both Miami backs are borderline flex options against the Saints since neither of them is likely to serve as a workhorse.\u00a0\n",

Freeman had seen at lest 13 rushing attempts in each of the Ravens' past four games -- including 13 carries and five receptions last week against the Browns -- and looked as if he had solidified himself as Baltimore's lead back. Apparently that was presumptuous. Latavius Murray took over as the team's lead back in the second half against Green Bay and ended with one more rush than Freeman. Freeman now looks like a shaky flex option for Week 16 against the Bengals.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "It only took three and a half months but it seems the Bills have landed on Singletary as the team's clear-cut lead back. He's dominated backfield snaps of late -- relegating Matt Breida to spot duty -- while Zack Moss has been inactive for most of the past month. \"Singletary has put his ball-security issues to rest and shown a spark with some chunk plays when the Bills have needed it,\" Buscaglia noted. Against Carolina in Week 15, Singletary ran for 86 yards and a score on 22 rushing attempts. He led Buffalo backs with 27 pass routes, though he only saw one target. Fantasy managers can finally trust Singletary as a low-ceiling RB2 play. He gets the Patriots in Week 16.\u00a0\n",

With Elijah Mitchell unlikely to return from his knee injury next week, expect Samuel to continue averaging five or more carries for the foreseeable future. He has now scored a rushing touchdown in five straight games. After catching one pass in three consecutive weeks, Samuel's uptick in receiving numbers was also a welcomed change.

He has also now reached 10 targets in 9-of-13 appearances. His score was a fourth quarter laser from Justin Herbert that the sophomore quarterback delivered into a pileup of traffic. There was a scary moment in the first half where Allen came up limping after tweaking his left foot, but he was good to go after having a heel pad put into his shoe. Allen now has 10 days to rest up for a fantasy semifinals smash spot in the Texans.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Brown was knocked out of Week 11 with a chest injury, and was placed on injured reserve prior to Week 12. His absence has coincided with a brutal stretch for the Titans passing game, where Ryan Tannehill has thrown for less than 200 yards in all three games. Tannehill managed just 93 passing yards against the Patriots in Week 12. Julio Jones' aggravation of his hamstring injury ensures that Brown will be the true focal point of the Titans' passing attack against the 49ers. It's possible that the Titans and 49ers both play with an ultra run-heavy approach, but the 49ers are vulnerable through the air, setting Brown up for a high ceiling. Brown profiles as a boom/bust WR2 if he is indeed healthy enough to play.\n",

He caught the Cardinals' lone touchdown on a well-run route that left him wide open in the end zone; a poorly thrown Kyler Murray pass wasn't enough to let Detroit defenders catch up to Kirk. It was a good start for Kirk in the post-DeAndre Hopkins Arizona offense. He'll be the team's lone deep threat and could see an influx in target volume down the season's final stretch. Kirk should be considered a low-end WR2 next week against the Colts.\u00a0\n",

Brown left the game briefly with a leg injury that didn't seem to affect him for the rest of the contest, though it will be something to monitor in practice this week. Brown's lack of downfield usage has firmly capped his fantasy output over the past couple months. He remains a fine WR2 option for Week 16 against the Bengals.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Flores added that Phillip Lindsay is also coming off the COVID list. Waddle missed Week 15 while on the list. In his absence, Mike Gesicki and DeVante Parker tied for a team-high in targets (eight). No other Dophions players saw more than three targets. Waddle should return to lead the team in targets. He is averaging 8.8 targets per game and is sixth in the NFL in receptions despite missing a game. Expect consistent WR2 numbers from the rookie going forward.\n",

With Chris Godwin (knee) out for the season and Mike Evans (hamstring) unlikely to play, a healthy Brown would be a major boost for the Buccaneers passing offense. Brown profiles as a low-end WR1 if Evans is out of the lineup.\n",

Gage is primarily used on short and intermediate routes but his increasing share of the Atlanta passing attack makes him a weekly WR3 with WR2 upside if he finds the paint. Gage should be able to keep his streak of strong outings going versus the Lions next week.\n",

Golladay managers will need to monitor Sterling Shepard's injury \u2013 the veteran slot receiver suffered a non-contact injury late in the fourth quarter and needed to be carted off. If he's out, Golladay could be in line for more targets. Consider him a lower-tier flex option in Week 16 against the Eagles.\n",

He ran a nice double move in single coverage in the red zone but was defended well and Allen didn't make the throw. He also got wide open in the 4th quarter but Allen took too long to find him and he was pushed out of bounds. Even with a few missed opportunities, Diggs wasn't set up for a huge day. The Bills played things more conservatively than usual against the Cam Newton-led Panthers. Hopefully, the Patriots can push the Bills a bit more in Week 16. Diggs remains a WR1.\u00a0\n",

St. Brown -- who saw 42.3 percent of the Lions' targets against Arizona -- now has 26 receptions on 35 targets over the team's past three games. His 57 receptions is a new Lions rookie record. Against an uninspired Arizona defense, St. Brown found open spots in the secondary time and again. He broke away from two Cardinals defenders in the first half to score his 37-yard touchdown -- his second touchdown of the year. St. Brown should continue operating as a target hog in the Lions offense with Hockensen done for the season after undergoing thumb surgery. He'll be a PPR WR2 in Week 16 against the Falcons.\u00a0\n",

Consider Gallup a low-end flex option in Week 16 against Washington.\n",

The first was a flat drop in the end zone. For the second, Williams got blown up right at the goal line and dropped the pass, injuring his right shoulder in the process. Williams remained down for several moments before making his way to the sideline. His arm was dangling at his side, but he ended up barely missing any time. Williams heads into an A+ Week 16 matchup with the Texans having cleared 100 yards just once in his past nine appearances. He has also found the end zone only one time in that timespan. The matchup is right, but Williams should be treated as a low-end WR2.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "The score was his first since Week 4. Parker also drew an end zone DPI to set the Dolphins up at the Jets' one at the 14:32 mark of the fourth quarter. One of Parker's missed connections was an end zone look, while he was wide open for a different painted area target where Tua Tagovailoa simply missed him, throwing to an enveloped Mike Gesicki instead. Parker nevertheless made fantasy managers' day with an 11-yard, game-winning score with 3:37 remaining, dusting Bryce Hall 1-on-1 near the goal line. With Jaylen Waddle (COVID-19) likely back for Week 16 vs. the Saints, Parker will return to being more of a WR3 than WR2, but he will be a legitimate option for the second round of the fantasy playoffs.\u00a0\n",

    "headlineNews": "Hunter Renfrow caught 3-of-5 targets for 32 yards in the Raiders' Week 15 win over the Browns.\n",
    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Renfrow's three straight 100-yard games entering this week clearly drew Cleveland's attention as he was the focus of their secondary throughout this game. His stat line doesn't show much but the attention he drew helped get his teammates open more than once. Still, Renfrow logging the second-lowest yardage total of his 2021 season will undoubtedly end the fantasy playoff hopes of many teams. Darren Waller has sidelined with a knee injury for a few weeks and it's unclear if he will be able to return for Week 16. If he remains out, Renfrow should be in line for a rebound game versus the Broncos.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "How did he catch zero passes but gain 12 yards, you ask? Well, Claypool was the recipient of a backward pass on a forward pass to a different receiver, so Claypool doesn't get credit for a catch on the play. He also rushed for seven yards on a carry, totaling 19 yards on one official touch. Claypool has just one touchdown on the season, coming all the way back in Week 5. He's devolved into a low-floor, minimal-upside WR4 at this point ahead of a Week 16 date with the Chiefs. Claypool has failed in so many prime on-paper spots.\n",

    "analysis": "It was quite the crash to statistical earth following Bateman's seven catch, 100-yard Week 14 outing against the Browns. And, concerningly, it happened with Sammy Watkins sidelined with COVID-19. The rookie was simply not part of the team's passing offense while Mark Andrews and Marquise Brown commanded 67.5 percent of the Ravens' targets. Bateman has been frustrating for fantasy purposes thanks to ever-shifting snap counts and target shares. Bateman will be a tough flex option next week against the Bengals if Watkins is back in the lineup.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Ertz's 26.9 percent target share was his highest as a Cardinal, and his target volume was driven by four quarters of nonstop negative game script. One of his catches came in garbage time after Kyler Murray had been pulled in the lopsided loss. Ertz didn't seem hampered by the hamstring injury he dealt with throughout the week, and he's established himself as a main piece of the Arizona passing attack with DeAndre Hopkins (knee) done for the season. He'll be a TE1 in Week 16 against a Colts defense that allows the third highest tight end target share.\n",

One of his missed connections came in the end zone, but it was a ball that should have never left Tua Tagovailoa's hands. The same was true of the first of Tua's two INTs, where Gesicki was the \"intended recipient\" in a crowd of Jets defenders. Although he continues to provide a decent floor, Gesicki hasn't had a ceiling effort in months. His last touchdown came in Week 7. Especially with Waddle likely to return, fantasy managers can't really count on anything different for Week 16 against the Saints, rendering\u00a0Gesicki a low-end TE1.\u00a0\n",

However, with the Saints opting for a run-heavy approach featuring a quarterback and a running back, it's hard to rely on any of their pass-catchers for weekly fantasy production. Vannett is a viable but rather weak TE2 streaming option for Week 15.\n",

Henry has astonishingly scored all nine of his touchdowns on only 31 catches since Week 4. He remains a touchdown-or-bust option in Week 16 against the Bills.\n",

Tucker's heroics saved the Ravens on a day that saw Marquise Brown drop three touchdowns and Baltimore struggle to get anything going on the ground against a middling Detroit front seven. Tucker has made all 16 of his field goal tries in the final minute of the game over his nine seasons in Baltimore. Tucker doesn't have the fantasy upside he had with the Flacco-era Ravens, but he's still an every-week play in 12-team formats.\u00a0\n",

Santos is not called on very often from 50-plus yards, making him an extra unlikely recipient of this kind of contract. There's a chance this deal could quickly become an albatross.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Fantasy football's No. 2 kicker in 2020 is cashing in on a profoundly efficient season in which he made 36 of 39 field goal attempts, banging through all 36 of his extra point tries. He established himself as one of the league's big-footed kickers by nailing eight of nine kickers over 50 yards. Sanders' extension includes a $10 million guarantee. His 2020 numbers stand in stark contrast to his 2019 stats, which include seven missed field goals on 30 attempts. Only the Cowboys and Falcons attempted more field goals than Miami in 2020, giving Sanders the opportunity necessary to become a waiver wire darling in fantasy. Sanders will probably be one of the most over-drafted kickers in fantasy football next season.\u00a0\n",

He was inactive in Week 5 against the Dolphins and backup kicker Matthew Wright drilled all three of his field goal tries, including a game-winning kick that temporarily relieved Urban Meyer's suffering. Lambo was once among the league's most accurate kickers, making 71 of his 75 field goal tries (94.6 percent) from 2017 to 2019. Wright shouldn't be considered a reliable fantasy option on a Jacksonville team that generates almost no positive game script. Lambo, meanwhile, has a good shot of landing on another team as a fill-in kicker.\u00a0\n",

The Bengals offense is among the league's most kicker friendly. Last season, Randy Bullock was fantasy's third highest scoring kicker when Joe Burrow went down with a season-ending knee injury.

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Patterson (5\u201910/181) was a three-star prospect that was rated as the 16th best kicker from the 2017 prep class. The Edwardsville, IL native struggled a bit as a freshman, converting 69 percent of his field goals while registering only two touchbacks on 24 kickoffs. However, Patterson showed consistent year-over-year improvement throughout his career, boosting his conversion rate to 75 percent in 2018 and 92 percent in 2019. In addition to his on-point accuracy, Patterson converted five-of-six attempts of 50 or more yards two seasons ago. His production slipped a bit in 2020, making 15-of-22 attempts, but five of those misses came from beyond the 50-yard threshold, so that should be accounted for. Though he doesn\u2019t possess the most imposing leg in the class, his touchback rate was decent, as 38-of-63 kickoffs were not returned. He will need to iron out his conversion rate if he is going to stick around at the NFL level. The Vikings only have one other kicker rostered, third-year boot Greg Joseph, who has just 20 career field goal attempts. Expect a true kicking completion to take place between Joseph and Patterson if the Vikings don't bring in anyone else.\n",

He could be a liability in coverage, however, ranking 90th among 97 qualifying safeties in coverage grade. Adams signed a four-year deal in August and the 26-year-old will attempt to reclaim his Pro Bowl form in 2022.\u00a0\n",
