Although Rodgers'\u00a0one-yard scramble in the first half gave the Packers an early two-score lead, his most impressive play was a 58-yard strike down the field to Allen Lazard (4/96/1) to ice the game with 2:54 remaining in the final quarter.

Both Brady and Drew Brees struggled to move the ball most of the night, but it was Brady who came up with the needed big plays and took care of the football. His two touchdowns were a three-yarder to Mike Evans for Evans' only catch of the game, and the second was a six-yard hookup with Leonard Fournette. Brady and the Bucs will head to Green Bay next Sunday for the NFC title and a trip to the Super Bowl on the line. It will be Brady's 14th conference championship game.\n",

    "analysis": "Jones played through a quad injury against the Saints but managed to dodge any setbacks. He was limited in practice on Wednesday and could threaten Leonard Fournette's role as the lead back on Sunday now that he's feeling better. Jones has primarily been limited to early downs this season, but coach Bruce Arians has been willing to ride the hot hand at times, too. Projecting this backfield is a challenge week-to-week. The injuries have only added to that.\n",

He salvaged his fantasy day with a 60-yard run at the beginning of the second half. Meanwhile, Jamaal Williams played 28 snaps and AJ Dillon logged nine snaps before exiting with a quad injury. DFS players shouldn't assume Jones' role will change this week against Tampa's stellar rush defense.\u00a0\n",

The injuries have only added to that.\n",

Coach Matt LaFleur ultimately got the best of the matchup, motioning Adams across the line of scrimmage pre-snap to free him for a one-yard score after S Nick Scott took a false step forward and got in Ramsey's way mid-chase. Adams' longest gain\u00a0was a 21-yard catch on the ensuing play after Jared Goff hit rookie Van Jefferson for a four-yard score. Whether it's the Buccaneers or Saints which travel to Lambeau in\u00a0the Conference Championship round, Adams will rank as the No. 1 receiver for any two-game DFS slates.\n",

With the Browns out of timeouts, that was the ballgame. Patrick Mahomes will likely be cleared from his concussion in time for next week's AFC Championship showdown with the Bills, but even if he's not, Hill's game-breaking upside will still warrant strong consideration\u00a0on a two-game DFS slate.\u00a0\n",

Obviously it's possible that the injury can be both non-serious and enough to sideline him for the NFC Championship Game. His practice reports on Thursday and Friday will tell the story. At this point, Brown's availability is up in the air. Scotty Miller would enter into three-receiver sets if Brown is ruled out.\n",

His lone downfield\u00a0target along the sideline was actually blown out of bounds by the wind coming from the player's tunnel. At the end of the day, Valdes-Scantling's\u00a0most impactful play was a four-yard gain in the fourth quarter to keep the team's final possession alive for Aaron Rodgers to find Lazard for a 58-yard touchdown just two plays later. Given their similar volume, MVS will still be a viable pivot off Lazard for any two-game DFS slates in the Conference Championship round.\n",
