    "report": "",
    "analysis": "It starts from the top. The Chargers were severely and unsurprisingly out-coached by New England. Coach Bill Belichick has been the best coach in league history against rookie quarterbacks, and today was another masterpiece. The Patriots changed up coverages on defense and created pressure against a backup left tackle. Herbert also watched his special teams allow two touchdowns, give up a 61-yard punt return, pick up\u00a0three penalties, and field either 10 or 12 players on the field more times than they had 11 players on the field on punts. The Chargers have ranked 23rd or worse in special teams DVOA in every season since 2014, including four seasons of 31st or worse. Herbert has all the upside in the world and the surrounding talent to be a playoff contender as soon as 2021, but this team is fully maxed out under the current regime. That arguably includes ownership as well. Herbert will be a bounceback QB1 against the Falcons in Week 12.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Watson was also charged with two fumbles and a loss, but it was the center's fault on a bad snap. His \"interception\" was a 50-50 ball that Brandin Cooks let get stolen away on a hard hit. Playing his first game without Will Fuller, Watson averaged nine yards per attempt and posted his third most passing yardage of the season against an elite defense. He found each of Keke Coutee and Chad Hansen for 100-yard days, while Brandin Cooks and Duke Johnson combined for 11 receptions. It was a heroic effort in the face of constant pressure from DeForest Buckner and the Colts' defensive line. That pressure did result in a second half safety where Watson got crunched in the end zone. What Watson showed today was as good as could have been hoped for with his B-team supporting cast, but on the road at Chicago is another tough matchup for Week 14. He will probably find himself in the QB9-12 range.\u00a0\n",

Wilson found Carson for a 28-yard touchdown over Jabrill Peppers in the fourth quarter, which helped extend the franchise's 58-game streak with a touchdown, but that was ultimately the only offensive score for the Seahawks as the Giants batted down Wilson's\u00a0final Hail Mary. Seattle now sits behind the Rams atop the NFC West at 8-4 with two divisional games left to play in the last\u00a0two weeks of the season.

Nearly 24 percent of his passes were more than 20 yards downfield, according to Pro Football Focus. In Week 12 against the Browns, Glennon was third among all QBs in deep shots. It's certainly not unwelcome\u00a0news for D.J. Chark, the team's primary downfield receiver who led the Jags in targets in Week 13. Glennon, quite shockingly, is a solid superflex option if he keeps the starting gig. He gets the Titans and their horrific secondary in Week 14.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Jackson also added an impressive 94 rushing yards and a score on 13 carries. After months of inconsistent play and a week\u00a0on the COVID-19 list, Jackson looked more confident despite missing Mark Andrews, Willie Snead, starting offensive linemen, and others. Jackson's highlight play was a QB keeper that went for a 37-yard rushing touchdown. His two passing touchdowns both came from 20-plus yards out thanks to non-stop blown assignments by the Cowboys defense. Jackson could've had a bigger day as a passer if he was simply more accurate. His mechanics seem to be an issue. With that said, Jackson has a cupcake schedule ahead of the fantasy playoffs and tonight's game was a positive overall. Jackson will be a QB1 against the Browns.\n",

Nick Foles, who was active as a backup against Detroit, could replace\u00a0Trubisky in Week 14.\n",

Eric Ebron and Diontae\u00a0Johnson each logged multiple drops. Overall, Roethlisberger's pass-catchers logged five drops at a minimum. It wasn't a perfect outing\u00a0from the 38-year-old quarterback but his supporting cast did him no favors. He should bounce back as a high-end QB2 versus Buffalo next week.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Tannehill, who threw 45 times, piled on garbage time yardage after the Browns decimated the Titans in the first half. He targeted Corey Davis a dozen times, and his day could have been even better if A.J. Brown had held on to a nicely thrown long ball in the second half. The Browns gave Tannehill anything he wanted underneath for the entire fourth quarter, so the Titans dinked and dunked their way to a couple late scores. Tannehill will be a low-end QB1 play next week against the Jaguars.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Bridgewater had a very forgettable day as a passer. He should've had D.J. Moore for a long touchdown and then missed him again for an easy red zone touchdown late in the game. Bridgewater is a fine starting quarterback but there seems to be a ceiling even with quality offensive pieces around him. On the last offensive play of the game during a two-minute drive, Bridgewater took a big hit and was barely able to move his arm while spiking the ball to stop the clock. He looked to be in pain while jogging off for the field goal attempt. It's unclear how serious his injury is, but the Panthers at least have the Week 13 bye to heal up.\n",

    "analysis": "Newton added seven carries for 16 yards. Listed as \"questionable\" with an abdomen injury, Newton was absolutely dismal in a non-competitive game, heading to the bench for the final 10 minutes with the Rams winning 24-3. Newton's surgically-repaired throwing arm/shoulder looked weaker than ever, with the veteran having to put everything he had into even short passes. Newton's interception was a pick six on a botched screen where Aaron Donald may have gotten a piece of Damien Harris. Presenting zero passing threat, the Rams teed off on Newton for three third quarter sacks. Newton could have made his night look better with a rushing score, but got stood up from the three and two-yard lines in the second quarter. Lucky to escape with only one turnover, Newton had the looks of a player running on empty. Speaking after the game, coach Bill Belichick did say he would be sticking with Newton. He has 10 days to rest up for an equally-foreboding Week 15 matchup with the Dolphins. Newton will be a zero-floor QB2 for that one.\u00a0\n",

This marked his third straight 300-yards, three-touchdown game, and he has multiple touchdowns in five straight contests. The Vikings are 5-1 over their last six, and Cousins is getting hot at the right time. His touchdowns in this one went to Adam Thielen, Justin Jefferson, and FB C.J. Ham. Cousins gets a tougher Week 14 date with the Bucs off Tampa's bye. He'll be more of a high-end QB2 for that one.\n",

    "analysis": "Tagovailoa struggled in the first half of the game, routinely missing throws and only taking what the defense gave him. He entered the week with a thumb injury and wasn't guaranteed to suit up versus Cincinnati. Tagovailoa didn't complete any of his three attempts of 10 yards or more downfield in the first half. He came out looking in rhythm in the second half and keyed in on Mike Gesicki's matchup versus the Cincinnati linebackers. The Miami offense is undoubtedly less exciting with Tagovailoa under center instead of Ryan Fitzpatrick but he has seven scores without an interception on the year. Week 13 will be a great test for Tagovailoa as he'll be pitted against Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs. He'll be a solid streaming option as a high-end QB2 in a presumed shootout with Kansas City.\n",

It was a very suspect game all around for the Raiders, including Carr. The Jets soft defense was mostly limiting the Raiders to shallow throws, but other offenses had success downfield against New York in recent weeks. Things changed on the last drive, however. With just a few seconds left and down a score, Carr found Henry Ruggs for a 46-yard score to seal the comeback win. It's a win-win for all involved as the Jets stay locked into the No. 1 pick of the 2021 NFL Draft. Carr will be a QB2/3 against the Colts' two-deep zone defense.\n",

Murray has compiled just 343 passing yards over the last two weeks, both Cardinals losses, but Murray was able to save his fantasy day with three scores in this one, tossing a meaningless late one to Dan Arnold. Arnold also caught Murray's first score, a 59-yarder on the fourth play of the game with no defender in sight. Murray's second score was a four-yard hookup with DeAndre Hopkins. The Cardinals have now lost three straight games and four of their last five, falling to 6-6, and in a battle for the final Wild Card spot. Murray gets another tough Week 14 draw at the Giants. He's obviously an elite QB1 for fantasy.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "It was a highly unimpressive performance, one where the Patriots weren't offering much respect to Goff's play fakes. Thankfully for Goff, the Pats' slow defense simply could not stop Cam Akers, who dominated the game and took pressure off his quarterback. Goff's\u00a0interception came on a low throw that Myles Bryant\u00a0managed to wrestle away from Robert Woods. As is the case in most \"bad Goff\" games, he was lucky to escape with only one turnover. His two-yard strike to Cooper Kupp in the end zone seemed to be lightly tipped. Goff's rushing score came on a fourth down quarterback sneak. Whereas Goff was always unlikely to perform well against Bill Belichick, he has a much more inviting Week 15 date in the Jets. Although he has only two passing scores over his past three starts, Goff has partly compensated with two rushing touchdowns.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

Darnold made some quality throws,\u00a0but his turnovers ended up costing him a win.

Even so, Jones caught a 37-yard touchdown from Tom Brady in the second quarter then egregiously had just one target for the rest of the game. Jones\u00a0also closed the game with a single touch after he sprinted upfield for a 34-yard run mid-third quarter. Overall, Tampa Bay's running back usage has been impossible to sift through, but it's very clear that Jones been the team's best back by a wide margin over the last month. Whether Arians finally begins treating him\u00a0as such is anyone's guess.\n",

Alfred Morris was called off the bench to vulture a touchdown after Gallman exploded for a 60-yard run in the third quarter, but the latter was clearly the team's workhorse for the second straight game. With 43 touches in his last two appearances, Gallman's floor has become safe for fantasy players to trust even if he's not punching in goal line touchdowns (as he did in five straight performances\u00a0prior to Sunday). He'll remain a high-end RB2 in Week 14 against the Cardinals if only for his continued volume ahead of Dion Lewis and Morris.\n",

He and Kirk Cousins muffed a handoff from the two-yard line, resulting in a turnover, and Cook was stuffed on a couple inside-the-five carries, including a second-and-goal carry from the two in overtime before a false start on third down that led to a game-winning field goal instead. Cook also watched FB C.J. Ham catch a 12-yard touchdown on a play-action. After Cook's down Week 12, it was good to see him rack up all these touches following last week's minor ankle \"injury.\" Cook is averaging 30.3 touches per game since returning from injury in Week 8. He's the unquestioned overall RB1 moving forward for the fantasy playoffs. Cook gets a Week 14 date with the Bucs.\n",

Look No. 2 was a pick six after Aaron Donald got a piece of Harris as he tried to leak out on a screen. Harris was finding some nice holes to run through, but the with the Patriots presenting zero passing threat, drives were impossible to sustain. There was also a scary moment late where Harris got shaken up in pass protection. He remained down on the field for several moments before heading to the sideline under his own power. That will be something to watch in the week ahead. That is also true of Sony Michel's re-emergence, as the third-year pro mixed in for 7/22. Harris will still be the lead back for Week 15 against the Dolphins, but bleeding any work cuts his extremely thin RB2 margins. Harris should be considered a low-upside FLEX for the fantasy semifinals.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Akers' hostile takeover of the Rams' backfield is complete, as he out-touched Darrell Henderson and Malcolm Brown a combined 31-2. Pro Football Focus charted him with 55 snaps compared to Henderson's seven and Brown's six. His 194 yards from scrimmage were the 12th most by any player all season. Akers' impressive 5.9 YPC would have been higher if not for some brick-walling late in obvious run situations. Running through enormous holes, Akers had four runs of 10-plus yards. Not that Akers wasn't tacking on yardage of his own. It was a flat dominant performance on an evening where Jared Goff wasn't offering much as a passer. Coach Sean McVay has made a habit of throwing curveballs in his backfield this season, but this genie isn't going back in the bottle. Akers will be the leader as the Rams look to seal the deal on a playoff spot. The pathetic Jets are a dream Week 15 matchup, one that will have Akers in the RB1 mix.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

Singletary out-touched Moss 21-4, but we'd venture to guess it's only a one-week punishment for Moss. Singletary can't be trusted as anything more than a low-floor RB3 for next week's tough date with the Steelers.\n",

Dobbins looked explosive between the tackles and found the end zone in the fourth quarter to top off his fantasy stat line. Unfortunately, the rookie didn't have the backfield to himself like he did before going on the COVID-19 list. It's unclear if missing practice played into that or if the Ravens want to mix in all of their running backs. Dobbins has an RB2 ceiling during the fantasy playoffs if Mark Ingram (6 carries) and Gus Edwards (7 carries) take more of a backseat. Dobbins belongs on the RB2/3 border against the Browns in Week 14.\n",

    "analysis": "Hines' score was a first quarter five-yarder where he saw the middle of the offensive line collapse and successfully bounced it outside. Hines could have had a second five-yard score in the fourth quarter, but he got stood up on a 4th-and-1. Coach Frank Reich was asked after the game why it wasn't Jonathan Taylor. That's because Taylor was by far the Colts' best back today, turning in his second straight excellent performance as bookends to his Week 12 COVID absence. Taylor out-touched Hines 16-9 and out-gained him 135-32. We might be looking at a changing of the guard in the Colts' backfield. Hines will nevertheless offer low-end PPR FLEX appeal for next week's soft matchup with the Raiders.\u00a0\n",

Taylor was moving the pile as a runner and contributed the Colts' biggest play of the day as a receiver. Unaccounted for on a 4th-and-4 early in the second quarter, Taylor took advantage of his free release to catch a Philip Rivers quick out and turn it into a 39-yard touchdown. Frustratingly, Taylor didn't receive a goal-line carry while Nyheim Hines converted one and failed on another. With Taylor playing his best two games of the season back-to-back, that probably won't remain an issue going forward, but it also can't be taken for granted. Coming on at the right time for the Colts, Taylor is back in the RB2 picture in fantasy. The Raiders are on tap for Week 14.\u00a0\n",

Moss was essentially benched after losing a fumble inside his own five-yard line in the first quarter, leading directly to a Niners touchdown. As a result, Devin Singletary touched the ball 21 times to Moss' four. We'd guess this will only be a one-week punishment. Prior to Monday, Moss had been out-snapping Singletary for weeks and getting more red-zone carries. Moss, however, can't be trusted for Week 14 fantasy lineups against Pittsburgh.\n",

    "analysis": "Aiyuk posted 95 yards and one touchdown on Monday night against Buffalo in his first appearance since Week 10. Aiyuk and Deebo Samuel each had nine targets. Aiyuk's production doesn't hinge on Samuel's availability, as he's a more traditional receiver option who can be used as a rusher too. Aiyuk has averaged 20.2 PPR points per game in his torrid four game stretch. He now leads the 49ers in expected fantasy points and is tied with Samuel for the team lead in target share. Aiyuk should be locked into fantasy lineups in Week 14 against Washington.\u00a0\n",

Hilton caught an 18-yard pass on the Colts' first play from scrimmage, and capped the drive with a 21-yard touchdown. Freed by a pick on a crossing route, Hilton found the sideline for the score. His best catch came six minutes later, where he hauled in a 21-yarder on the right sideline that appeared obviously incomplete to the naked eye. Replay reviewed revealed awesome footwork and a legal grab. Hilton's heater is too late for fantasy managers who took the early-round plunge, but he has a soft Weeks 14 and 15 playoff schedule in @LV and vs. HOU.\u00a0\n",

Jalen Hurts found Reagor in tight coverage down the left sideline midway through the third quarter before Reagor's house call on special teams in the fourth. Hurts, who is a 1-2 read quarterback right now, is not the world's greatest Plan B, but Plan A Wentz is fundamentally broken.

Gallup led the team in targets (11) and found the end zone for the first time since Dak Prescott's season-ending injury in Week 5. It's been a throw-away season for Gallup, mostly for no fault of his own. Gallup continues to show that he's a high-caliber NFL receiver when given chances. His box scores have simply just been hurt by poor quarterback and offensive line play. Gallup has some flex appeal in Week 14 against the Bengals following his best game in months. None of the Dallas receivers offer much of a floor right now, however.\n",

He's been a big beneficiary in the wake of the John Brown injury and with the Bills using more three- and four-wide sets in 2020. Beasley is well on his way to a new career high in receiving yards, needing 37 more to break his previous best from 2016. Beasley was the recipient of Josh Allen's first of four touchdowns in this one, scoring from five yards out. Beasley will be a WR3 next week at home against the Steelers.\n",

Sims has clearly separated himself as the No. 2 wide receiver in this offense. After Sims and McLaurin, Isaiah Wright was the only Washington receiver to see a target. Sims now has two games over 90 yards in his past five contests. However, he also a game without a target in that span. Sims is worth adding in deep fantasy leagues but isn't a reliable starter yet.\n",

Goedert also weathered the return of Zach Ertz, who caught two balls for 31 yards following his marathon absence. The question now is how Goedert will fare against the Saints in Week 14 if the Eagles actually make the switch to Hurts. The rookie was unquestionably better than Wentz today, but he might not share\u00a0his teammate's proclivity for only targeting the seam. Wentz completed just one pass to wideouts before his benching. Regardless of what happens, Goedert will be impossible to fade out of the top eight for the first week of the fantasy playoffs.\u00a0\n",

Jets DC Gregg Williams had no answers for the chain mover, so the funneling never stopped for all four quarters. Waller has firmly established himself as the only tight end capable of having Travis Kelce-like production in 2020. He'll be the TE2 overall against the Colts in Week 14.\n",
