He added an eight-yard touchdown to Mark Andrews in the fourth quarter but got picked off twice after that to dim Baltimore's comeback hopes before connecting for a 50-yard score with Willie Snead in garbage time. While Jackson has made strides as a passer, he's still much more comfortable operating with a run-pass balance, though big deficits open up the possibility of fantasy-friendly garbage-time production. Jackson remains a high-tier fantasy quarterback ahead of a Week 5 trip to Pittsburgh."

Sunday showed that Mahomes is mortal; it just so happens that mortal -- for him -- still includes 369 total yards."

The fourth-year quarterback now has 117 pass attempts in the last pair of contests following Thursday's hefty workload, once again largely necessitated by the stumbles of the Rams' defense. Goff connected with seven different pass catchers on the night and showed outstanding chemistry with tight end Gerald Everett, who racked up a game-high 136 yards. Goff also had to endure the early exit of Brandin Cooks, who left the game for good in the second half to be evaluated for a concussion. Ultimately, Goff put the Rams in position for a narrow win by spearheading a 10-play, 67-yard drive that set Greg Zuerlein up for a would-be game-winning 44-yard field goal that went wide right with 11 seconds remaining. In the wake of back-to-back crushing losses, Goff and his teammates will look to regroup ahead of a Week 6 divisional clash versus the 49ers a week from Sunday."

In a contrast to last week, Rivers had plenty of time to survey the field. He routinely hit the aforementioned targets underneath, or particularly in Inman's case, on back-shoulder fades, while easily marching down the field. It won't be smooth sailing in Week 5, however, as the Broncos' vaunted secondary travels to Los Angeles."

Rodgers otherwise thrilled the Lambeau crowd throughout the contest, shining with touchdown passes to Jimmy Graham and Geronimo Allison, as well as with 10 completions for 180 yards to Davante Adams. The perennial Pro Bowler's ill-timed pick was his first of the season, while Rodgers' 46 rushing yards were easily a season-high figure.

        "analysis": "Taking on the unbeaten defending NFC champions on the road, Winston showed thorough mastery of coach Bruce Arians' offense for the first time, helping the Buccaneers produce a franchise-record point tally. The fifth-year gunslinger was nearly flawless for the majority of the contest, but the pick-six he threw to Marcus Peters in the fourth quarter helped keep the game's outcome in the balance for a while longer. That mistake aside, Winston constantly was a step ahead of coordinator Wade Phillips' defense, showing particular chemistry with Chris Godwin, who overcame a hip injury to connect with Winston for 12 completions, 172 yards and two touchdowns. Winston also showed a propensity for answering when the Rams drew closer, hitting Mike Evans on a perfectly executed stop-and-go route for a 67-yard score early in the fourth quarter to extend Tampa's lead to 45-27 at the time. Winston now has thrown for a combined 685 yards and seven touchdown passes over his last two games and will look to extend his stellar stretch of play in a divisional road showdown versus the Saints in Week 5."

        "analysis": "The Eagles predictably leaned on the running game in this contest, as the Packers' secondary had shown considerable improvement over last season across the first three games. However, with the ground attack working to the tune of 159 combined rushing yards from Jordan Howard and Miles Sanders, the Green Bay defense was kept honest enough to enable Wentz to find occasional success when dropping back. The fourth-year quarterback hit two of his banged-up pass catchers, Alshon Jeffery and Dallas Goedert, for second-quarter touchdown passes, and he subsequently connected with Jordan Howard for a 20-yard scoring toss in the third quarter. Wentz now has multiple touchdown passes in three of the first four games of the season, and although Thursday's yardage tally was his lowest of the campaign, the 26-year-old did remain free of interceptions for the third contest of the season as well. Having played an integral role in the Eagles evening their record at 2-2, Wentz will turn his sights to building up his numbers against the Jets in a Week 5 battle a week from Sunday."

        "analysis": "Dalton had a would-be touchdown dropped on the Bengals' second offensive drive, and it all went downhill from there. Not only did he twice turn the ball over in the red zone, but he was also constantly under siege from Pittsburgh's pass rush, resulting in a career high amount of sacks taken. Considering Dalton entered Monday averaging 326.3 passing yards per game, it's likely he rebounds in Week 5 against the also-winless Cardinals. However, in order to do so, he'll need far improved protection from his linemen up front, and still won't have top wideout A.J. Green (ankle) at his service."

Wilson ended up throwing three more scores, including a game-winner to Chris Carson with 2:28 remaining in regulation. He finished the contest with a season-high 11.7 yards per attempt, and this was the fourth time in five games he completed over 70 percent of his passes.

        "analysis": "The versatile centerpiece paced all players in receiving during the NFC West showdown against Seattle and led Arizona in the category for the first time since Week 10 of last season. Johnson's 3.7 yards-per-carry average is only marginal improvement from his 3.6 yards-per-attempt clip of a year ago, as the Cardinals' offensive line remains well below average from a personnel standpoint. So long as he continues to make an impact in the passing game, however, Johnson will remain a top-flight fantasy back. His Week 5 outlook is extremely encouraging, as he'll be going up against a Bengals defense that last year gave up the second-most receiving yards to opposing running backs and has been torched for 5.2 yards per carry by the position through its first three appearances of 2019."

The Saints defense appeared determined to not let the Cowboys' run game get going, and that strategy paid off in a low-scoring, defensive affair. A positive takeaway for Zeke's fantasy owners would be that the back garnered 100 percent of Dallas' running back carries. The 24-year-old is still the workhorse of the backfield even with backup Tony Pollard (zero touches) blowing up for 100-plus yards last week. Elliott will look to get back on track against a Packers defense that has allowed opposing rushing attacks to rack up a whopping 142.3 yards per game."

Although coach Ron Rivera and coordinator Norv Turner previously mentioned their preseason hope to scale back McCaffrey's snaps while still increasing his touches, the superstar tailback has only grown in both capacities thus far. Furthermore, with the Panthers looking to keep pace while quarterback Cam Newton (foot) remains sidelined, the ultra-productive McCaffrey only figures to continue carrying the offense, arguably making him fantasy's most-coveted commodity."

Kamara's only shortcomings have been in terms of touchdowns (two through four games after tallying 18 through 15 games last year). The versatile back doesn't profile as a short-yardage/goal-line back, but he has shown to have a nose for the end zone and remains on the field in formations closer to the goal line. Expect Kamara to continue to be a focal point of the Saints offense in a soft matchup against the Buccaneers in Week 5."

More information regarding whether or not Mack is trending toward suiting up may arrive before the first wave of games kick off Sunday, but he'll be a risky lineup option in the absence of additional news. Since the Colts and Chiefs are playing in the Sunday night game, Indianapolis won't have to offer official word on Mack's status until releasing its inactive list 90 minutes before the 8:20 p.m. ET kickoff."

However, Gurley's usage, seemingly due to a combination of workload management and game script, continues to be limited; he's yet to exceed 16 carries or 19 total touches from scrimmage in any contest this season. Naturally, fantasy managers who invested significant draft capital in Gurley are disappointed to an extent, and his outlook doesn't figure to be much brighter in a Week 6 divisional battle versus a tough 49ers front seven a week from Sunday."

Even more discouraging was the fact that Lindsay was targeted just once, especially considering Royce Freeman saw six passes go his direction. While this was the first game in which Lindsay didn't receive double-digit carries, he has averaged just 3.9 yards per rush this season and appears to be reliant on pass volume and touchdowns to maintain fantasy relevance. He'll look to bounce back in Week 5 against the Chargers."

        "report": "Coach Anthony Lynn suggested Friday that Gordon's workload may be limited in the running back's season debut this weekend against the Broncos, Gilbert Manzano of The Orange County Register reports. \"I don't want to put him in there and play him too much, and I really don't have to,\" Lynn said of Gordon. \"I like what Austin Ekeler has been doing.\"",
        "analysis": "The Chargers' official site now lists Gordon atop the depth chart at running back, but that doesn't mean he'll immediately take back the nearly 20 touches per game he averaged in 12 regular-season starts in 2018. Since Gordon has only had two weeks of practice time following his 64-day holdout, the Chargers are cognizant of easing him into the mix, with Ekeler's solid performance over the first four games affording the team that luxury. The prospect of a restricted snap/touch count makes Gordon a risky selection in DFS contests, though he might still have a path to enough touches this week to bring value in season-long leagues."

In fact, Peterson has totaled just 90 yards on 33 carries (2.7 yards per carry) through Week 4 while making a minimal impact as a pass-catcher (four receiving yards on five targets). With that said, the Redskins don't have many viable alternatives for carries at the moment and should continue to use Peterson until they fall far enough behind to abandon the run game. This will likely remain the case in next Sunday's home matchup with the Patriots."

Howard's pair of rushing scores came in his usual red-zone/goal-line role, as he went in from one and two yards out in the second and fourth quarter, respectively. He sandwiched those visits to the end zone around a 20-yard scoring grab early in the third quarter to cap off a 76-yard drive that erased a slim 21-20 deficit. Howard has now seen his carries increase over that of the prior game in each contest, while his receptions, receiving yards and targets Thursday were all season highs. While the Eagles' backfield situation is far from ideal due to the timeshare between Howard and Miles Sanders, the former looks like a viable play in all formats for a Week 5 interconference battle versus the Jets a week from Sunday."

The more dynamic Jones appears to be progressively pulling away with the lead-back job, although it will take multiple weeks with the USC product helming the ground attack for fantasy managers to have complete confidence in that arrangement.

The good news for Freeman is that -- despite his power-back reputation -- he's actually become a fairly prolific receiver with 13 catches in his last three games. The Broncos like Freeman on passing downs as he's a sturdy blocker, so look for that trend to continue Sunday against the Chargers."

Williams' workload may be managed carefully in his first game back from the injury, but he could eventually reclaim the top spot on the depth chart and push McCoy into more of a complementary role in the backfield."

That represented the biggest disparity in opportunity between the two backs in Jones' favor this season and could be indicative of a gradual changing of the guard at running back. Barber will look to make his case and up his production in a divisional matchup versus the Saints in Week 5."

With Williams sustaining a concussion in the Week 4 win over the Eagles and having yet to resume practicing in any capacity, however, the rookie looks on track to make his debut by virtue of being the lone healthy backfield option available behind starter Aaron Jones and fullback Danny Vitale. In such a scenario, Jones would likely handle an even greater snap share than he usually does, but Williams could be in store for a handful of touches when the veteran needs a breather."

Sanders also showed well while moonlighting as the Eagles' sole kick returner, and although backfield mate Jordan Howard stole the headlines with three total touchdowns, Sanders' second consecutive strong effort on the ground after a sluggish first two weeks was highly encouraging for the rookie's fantasy managers. Moreover, although he surprisingly wasn't targeted in the passing game, that seems like a clear outlier after Sanders logged 10 looks over the first three contests. The Penn State product will look to build on Thursday's effort in a Week 5 interconference showdown against the Jets a week from Sunday."

Beckham didn't make a catch until the fourth quarter but showed off his athleticism on a trick play, avoiding a pair of would-be tacklers in the backfield before uncorking a deep ball that went right through the hands of Damion Ratley. It's good to see the Browns trying to find other ways to get the ball in Beckham's hands, but second-year quarterback Baker Mayfield has regressed after a strong finish to his rookie season, leading to a relatively quiet start to the year for the star receiver, outside of his 89-yard touchdown against the Jets in Week 2. Expect Beckham to bounce back on Monday Night Football in San Francisco in Week 5, especially if Landry's unable to suit up."

The forced switch from Drew Brees (thumb) to Teddy Bridgewater hasn't slowed the star wideout down too much. He is seeing five less targets per game, but he has 20.9 standard fantasy points in the two games started by Bridgewater compared to 21.2 in the two games that Brees started. Thomas is talented enough to possess WR1 upside regardless of situation, and in Week 5 he'll have the benefit of facing off against a Tampa Bay defense that's given up at least 300 passing yards in each of the last three games."

Chris Godwin has clearly ascended to at least the 1-A option at receiver, but as Evans demonstrated Sunday, he's still highly capable of providing big plays in his own right. He'll look to add to the four touchdowns he's accumulated over that last pair of contests when the Buccaneers face off with the Saints in a Week 5 divisional clash."

Late in the first quarter, Wilson scrambled out of the pocket and tossed a pass to the back corner of the end zone, where Lockett dragged his feet and leaned out of bounds for the team's first touchdown of the evening. It doesn't look like Lockett, who also logged four targets in Week 4, will consistently draw the sort of volume he did between Weeks 2 and 3, when he saw a combined 26 looks, but he continues to see plenty of snaps in Seattle's offense, including a 91 percent share Thursday night."

He is back to being a fantasy producer after a down 2018 in which he only logged 69 receptions for 734 yards, as he is currently on pace to account for 92 receptions, 1,200 yards and eight touchdowns if his first-quarter regular-season stats were to be extrapolated out to 16 games.

Moore has seen only seven combined targets over the two games thus far that have featured Allen under center, compared to the 24 looks he logged across the first pair of contests of the season when Cam Newton (foot) was at the controls. The 2018 first-round pick is capable of much more than the four receptions and 96 yards he compiled over Weeks 3 and 4, so he'll look to improve his chemistry with Allen during the practice week ahead of a Week 5 home game against the Jaguars."

        "analysis": "Pettis' groin injury was kept under wraps to begin the season, and this pectoral injury is only now being announced to the public despite it developing during the preseason. This could help explain the second-year wideout's lack of production through three weeks (five receptions on six targets for 27 yards and a touchdown). The good news is that Shanahan stated that Pettis has been regaining both lower- and upper-body strength, and that culminated in the receiver's best stat line against the Steelers in Week 3 (four receptions for 20 yards and a touchdown). The 49ers' upcoming bye week could help the 23-year-old inch even closer to midseason form. While fantasy owners are unlikely to trust Pettis enough to start him following the rough start, it is worth noting that he has been seeing nearly as many offensive snaps over the past two games (68) as rookie Deebo Samuel (70). It appears that the two youngsters are in a starter's timeshare alongside Marquise Goodwin, who leads all San Francisco wide receivers with 90 offensive snaps over that same two-week period."

The big-bodied wideout makes for an appealing red zone target for Andy Dalton, and he's facing a prime matchup against Arizona's struggling defense Week 5. The stars appear to be aligning for the second-year pro to attain notable fantasy value, though Tyler Boyd will likely remain Dalton's first read until A.J. Green (ankle) returns to the lineup."

Overall, he has just 17 targets and 10 receptions through four games, but he has quickly proven to be a big-play threat by averaging 22.3 yards per reception.

        "analysis": "Beasley edged out John Brown by one target, two catches and six yards for the team lead in each category. Starting quarterback Josh Allen got knocked out of the game in the fourth quarter with a concussion, but backup Matt Barkley proved capable of moving the offense effectively with 127 passing yards after coming in. While Buffalo's red-zone efficiency will likely suffer without the threat of Allen running the ball, the team's receivers could actually benefit from having a more accurate quarterback under center should Allen need to sit out against the Titans in Week 5 or beyond, though having Allen back clearly gives the offense more long-term upside."

Given his lack of volume, Hardman's fantasy value will mainly be derived from a long touchdown grab as it was in each of the past two weeks. Tyreek Hill's (shoulder) eventual return also figures to eat away at his fantasy value."

He came alive a little against Jacksonville, particularly on a shot up the sideline in the second quarter in which he gained 28 yards. Those sorts of plays -- even if Hamilton continues to improve -- are unlikely as he does most of his best work underneath, but Sunday showed some improved rapport with quarterback Joe Flacco that will be worth tracking. Next up is a Chargers team that has had an uneven start to the season."

On three straight downs at the one-yard line, Aaron Rodgers targeted Graham, with the final pass ultimately getting intercepted on a deflection. Graham still corralled his lone other red-zone target for a touchdown earlier in the game and finished with season highs in receptions (six) and yards (51), a welcome development after he failed to catch a pass in both of the prior two weeks. Given that Adams is now slated to miss a full game along with the fact that few established options exist behind him on the depth chart at receiver, Graham should once again be one of Rodgers' favored reads in the passing game."

Ertz will look to cross the goal line for the first time in a Week 5 battle against the Jets a week from Sunday."

The third-year tight end also has been kept out of the end zone thus far in 2019, so fantasy managers who invested solid draft capital have to be bristling at his middling production, especially in a game during which the Buccaneers scored a franchise-record 55 points. Howard will look to put together his first breakout effort of the season in a Week 5 divisional matchup against the Saints."

That Sunday's three receptions and 49 yards both tied or set season highs is not great for Jarwin, who plays behind veteran Jason Witten, but the third-year player may be due for a few more opportunities. Tied for a team-high three receptions of at least 20 yards, Jarwin adds a different dimension than Witten that might be useful against a stingy Packers pass defense in Week 5."
