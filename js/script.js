Murray's passing scores were a 41-yard strike to A.J. Green where AJG just beat the defense down the field and a 14-yarder to emerging TE2 consideration Maxx Williams. Murray has played at an MVP level as the Cards have raced to a 4-0 record despite some sloppy mistakes. They are dangerous enough on offense right now to overcome penalties and time management miscues. The reeling 49ers are a wild card Week 5 matchup.\u00a0 \u00a0\n",

That saved face on the fake gridiron, but this was Stafford's first face plant as a Los Angeles transplant. He was sailing throws and escaped with just the one turnover thanks to a roughing the passer penalty that negated a second pick. Stafford did appear to notch a fourth quarter rushing touchdown but was ruled down and the Rams declined to challenge. It was a frustrating day, but we are still more inclined to believe in Weeks 1-3 Los Angeles instead of this week's group. That will be especially true for Thursday's plus matchup in the Seahawks.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Wilson showed off his incredible finesse on multiple plays despite Pete Carroll's resistance to letting him cook. His first magic trick came on a rushing touchdown where he showed his speed and beat Javon Kinlaw to the pylon. On the next drive, Wilson evaded multiple defenders while escaping the pocket and hit Freddie Swain for a 13-yard score. The only thing holding Wilson back is his coaching, but we've known this for years. The Seahawks ran the ball more often than they threw it this week and have been playing incredibly slow all year. Even on limited volume, Wilson is efficient enough to post QB1 numbers on a weekly basis. His matchup with the Rams next week should feature plenty of scoring, giving him a sky-high ceiling for Week 5.\u00a0\n",

Moore (8/113/2) for six- and eight-yard scores before the final whistle. Infamous for having a soft opening schedule through the team's first six games, Darnold will continue benefitting as a low-end QB1 in OC Joe Brady's uptempo scheme in Week 5 against the Eagles.\n",

Carr can enter the record books yet again with\u00a0at least 375 yards and two touchdown passes on Monday night against the Chargers, which would mark the first time in league history that a quarterback has ever accomplished that feat in each of the first four games of the year.\n",

Herbert continued to show ridiculous ball placement and appear like he is taking a step forward on his truly elite rookie campaign. There was a scary moment where Herbert jammed his throwing hand, but he literally shook it off and did not miss a play. The Raiders are a mouthwatering Week 4 matchup.\u00a0\n",

He ended the game with a bad pick in the end zone on a ball intended for Courtland Sutton, and seemed generally out of sync with Sutton in their two quarters on the field together. Denver's offense is a fragile one that depends on a game manager like Bridgewater avoiding big mistakes and taking timely downfield shots to Sutton and Tim Patrick. With Lock under center, the Broncos would go from a playoff contender to a bottom dweller. Lock should only be considered in superflex formats next week against the Steelers.\u00a0\n",

Ryan could continue to get by on pure volume next week against a soft Jets secondary. He'll be a sneaky borderline WR1 option in Week 5.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "The Bengals took their first lead as time expired in the fourth quarter, with Evan McPherson kicking the game-winning field goal after Burrow found TE C.J. Uzomah for yet another big play. With Tee Higgins (shoulder) on the shelf for his second and apparently final game, Burrow predictably peppered Tyler Boyd and Ja'Marr Chase with targets. Boyd did work after the catch with Chase making tough grabs in traffic. Uzomah was the X factor, however, getting free over the middle of the field and rolling toward the end zone like a bowling ball en route to 5/95/2. Burrow set season highs across the board this evening, with the 300-yard effort being his first of 2021. He averaged an eye-popping 10.9 yards on his 32 attempts, thanks in part to his pass catchers' YAC work. Burrow has been passing the eye test even as the Bengals work to limit his volume coming off his ACL tear. He's going to have to air it out in next week's home showdown with the Packers.\u00a0\n",

Allen settled in and did the usual Allen things, impacting the game with his legs and slinging darts, but the end result is a bit of a disappointing point total in an obvious smash spot. Allen will remain a high-end QB1 for a Sunday-nighter against an extremely flammable Chiefs defense in Week 5.\n",

Brady struggled in the red-zone without Rob Gronkowski, and he missed on back-to-back deep shots to Antonio Brown late in the game. After throwing nine touchdowns the first two games, Brady has just one touchdown over the past two weeks. Brady, who passed Drew Brees as the all-time leader in passing yards, will look to get on track in a matchup with the Dolphins in Week 5.\n",

Winston is averaging 22 attempts, which isn't close to enough for QB1 returns unless you have Russell Wilson-level efficiency. Winston, of course, has neither Wilson-ian efficiency nor weapons, so this is going to be the toughest of scenes, at least until Michael Thomas returns and re-centers the Saints' talent-barren receiver corps.

    "analysis": "Touted as the league's best defense despite opening against a cupcake schedule in their first three games, Prescott and Dallas' offense silenced Carolina's defense with 433 yards and 7.7 yards per play, finishing with a squeaky clean box score with zero sacks taken and no turnovers. The Cowboys moved the ball at will without CeeDee Lamb (2/13) making a significant impact, calling manufactured plays for Dalton Schultz (5/50/1) while getting 204 combined rushing yards from Ezekiel Elliott (19/142/1) and Tony Pollard (9/62). Amari Cooper also beat C.J. Henderson one-on-one for a 35-yard touchdown following a perfectly placed ball dime Prescott in the third. The only downside to Dallas' passing offense at this time is the fact Prescott hasn't been asked or needed to throw more than 27 attempts in three consecutive games. Even so, he'll stay a top-five option in next week's soft matchup against the Giants.\n",

Between that called-back score and Marquise Brown's three dropped touchdowns in Week 4, Jackson's passing numbers should look far better than they do through the season's first month. Jackson played conservatively for much of the game against a vicious Denver defense that pressured L-Jax on nearly every drop back. The safe play paid off against a Broncos team that stood no chance of scoring after Teddy Bridgewater exited the contest with a brain injury. The Ravens get four home games in a row starting in Week 5 against the Colts. Jackson will again be an elite QB1 option.\u00a0\n",

The veteran passer finally began to take downfield shots but it was too little too late as the game had been out of reach for some time by that point. Brissett added a trio of carries for eight yards on the ground. Through a little less than three games of action, Brissett is averaging just 4.9 yards per pass attempt and is getting sacked three times per game. He gets a potentially exciting matchup with the Bucs next week but it's impossible to find a sense of optimism after watching his poor play in relief of Tua Tagoaviloa. He's a weak option at quarterback even in Superflex leagues.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Wentz got the job done but it wasn't always pretty. He took a pair of sacks in the first half and looked shaken up at one point but the Colts' three-score lead in the second half made his job fairly easy. Both of his scores wound up in the hands of Mo Allie-Cox. Wentz avoided the big mistakes that plagued him last year but still looks limited by his ankle issues and failed to make any big-time throws versus Miami. He'll get a massive test in Week 5 as he and the Colts will travel to Baltimore to face the Ravens. In a difficult matchup, Wentz can only be trusted as a low-end QB2 next week.\n",

Jones was buoyed by big-time YAC efforts from Saquon Barkley, Kadarius Toney and Kenny Golladay, who each drew at least six targets. Jones' \"interception\" was a first half Hail Mary. Jones was making big-time throws and giving his wideouts space to make plays. He has unquestionably appeared better this season while cutting down on his turnovers. A potential Week 5 shootout with the Cowboys looms as a massive test.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Lawrence's night got off to an ominous start when D.J. Chark broke his ankle on the fourth play from scrimmage. That is going to be a major concern going forward, but Lawrence settled in this evening after some early inaccuracy caused primarily by late throws. Lawrence finally got his connection with Laviska Shenault going, finding the second-year pro for 6/99, including a 52-yard deep bomb for the normally YAC-focused wideout. What really kept the Bengals' defense off balance was Lawrence's rushing, with the rookie skillfully executing a number of read-option runs, including his seven-yard touchdown in the second quarter. The Jags are going to need a lot more of that going forward considering their personnel issues at wideout. Although tonight was easily Lawrence's best start as a pro, he will be a borderline top-18 option for next week's divisional date with the Titans.\u00a0\n",

He's constantly throwing short of the sticks on third and fourth downs. Big Ben isn't even start-able in two-QB leagues ahead of a Week 5 date with the Broncos.\n",

    "analysis": "Sanders was more involved out of the backfield, catching all three of his targets for 34 yards. The Eagles went pass heavy for the second straight week, calling just 11 designed runs. Sanders has had a rough start to the season, going over 100 total yards in just one game, and he's still yet to score a touchdown. Injuries to the Eagles offensive line haven't helped, but the declining workloads for Sanders\u00a0are starting to become a concern. Kenneth Gainwell has 13 touches over the last two weeks and is a threat to Sanders's snaps.\u00a0\n",

Despite the rushing volume, Sermon is clearly not trusted with work on passing downs.\u00a0Kyle Juszczyk saw the only four targets that went to running backs (or fullbacks) for San Francisco this week. As long as Elijah Mitchell is out, Sermon can comfortably be projected to hit 15 carries even in losing efforts. However,\u00a0Juszczyk's role in the red zone and as a pass-catcher severely caps Sermon's ceiling. He'll sit on the RB2/3 border until Mitchell returns, which could be as early as Week 5 against the Cardinals.\n",

The Saints were gutting New York on the ground, and backup Tony Jones was lost to a first half ankle injury. Kamara has now cleared 20 carries three times in four contests after entering 2021 with just one such effort his entire career. It's affecting his passing-game usage, but coming close to offsetting his lost points in fantasy. Kamara will still have huge pass-catching afternoons, as well. For Week 5 he gets a Washington defense fresh off getting shredded by Cordarrelle Patterson.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "We worried Henderson might find himself in something of a timeshare with Sony Michel after Henderson played into coach Sean McVay's durability concerns with his Week 2 ribs injury. That was a mistake, and a moot point after a horrific Michel first quarter fumble. Henderson picked up where he left off before the injury, looking dangerous side to side and stacking up chunk gains even as the Rams' offense otherwise looked out of sync. Most importantly, he stayed healthy ahead of a short-week matchup with the Seahawks' egregious run defense. Henderson will be a top-18, and you could argue much higher, running back for Week 5.\u00a0\n",

Swift's usage as a rusher was disappointing but he did see a goal line carry, and was targeted in the end zone on a pass that was tipped. Swift looks likely to remain on the wrong side of the rushing split in Week 5, but he has a clear lead on Williams as a receiver. With Swift mixing in around the goal line, he can be considered a RB1 against the Vikings.\n",

He caught just one pass for five yards and has just four catches on the season. When Chubb isn\u2019t finding the end zone, his stat lines leave a lot to be desired in fantasy with his empty pass-game role. Chubb was stuffed at the goal line in the first half before Kareem Hunt (14-69-1) converted from one yard out a few plays later for the Browns\u2019 lone touchdown. Chubb will be a TD-dependent RB1 next week at the Chargers.\n",

Mixon then missed the end of the game as he battled a \"minor\" ankle injury in the words of coach Zac Taylor. Mixon's injuries have had a way of lingering, but he has 10 days to get healthy for Week 5 against the Packers. Mixon certainly did not seem to be battling a high-ankle sprain on the sideline.

Carson only saw one target. On top of the forming committee in Seattle, Collins looked like the better runner, posting 44 yards and finding the end zone. It's not time to anoint Collins the starter but his volume will need to be monitored in Week 5, With Carson already seeing little usage as a receiver, he needs to dominate the carries in Seattle to maintain RB2 numbers. He stays in the top-20 running backs versus the Rams this week but is now a considerably riskier bet.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "After missing Week 3 with an ankle injury, Cook got the start in this one and said before the game he expected to have his normal workload role. He carried the ball just six times for 17 yards in the first half and then limped off and barely played in the final 30 minutes before three fourth-quarter carries. The Vikings never announced anything, but it looked like Cook aggravated his previous injury. Alexander Mattison ended up out-carrying Cook 10-9. Cook added two catches for 10 yards to his stat line. He gets a real juicy Week 5 date with the Lions, but Cook\u2019s ankle is a big concern.\n",

He was doing yeoman's work, tacking on Capital T Tough yardage after first contact. That includes near the goal line, where he scored a six-yarder after a textbook plant-and-cut. He followed up with a four-yarder where he pile drove to the plane. Robinson was one of the main reasons the Jags almost snapped their 18-game losing streak. Regardless of Hyde's health, Robinson has taken back complete control of the Jags' backfield after coach Urban Meyer tried every other option first. He will be a locked-in RB2 for Week 5 vs. the Titans.\u00a0\n",

The Chiefs boat raced the Eagles for four quarters, allowing\u00a0Edwards-Helaire to stay involved with positive game script.\u00a0Darrel Williams had a season-high 10 carries and vultured a goal-line TD, but Edwards-Helaire's turnovers and early-season struggles look behind him. The Chiefs have another potential shootout with a Sunday night matchup against Buffalo in Week 5.\n",

Brown and Ahmed combined for three targets. Miami couldn't mount much of an offense but Gaskins' role is the bigger concern. If he isn't involved as a receiver going forward, he'll be dusted for fantasy purposes. He's an easy stay-away in a grueling matchup with the Bucs next week.\u00a0\n",

It's safe to assume that Gruden will only ride Barber if Jacobs is inactive, despite his glowing comments on the journeyman runner. Barber tallied 23 carries and five targets in the Raiders' Week 3 win. They'll be underdogs against Los Angeles which will ensure Barber doesn't log 26 touches again but he could be in line for RB2 numbers if Jacobs can't go. Kenyan Drake saw 11 touches last week and is nothing more than a deep FLEX option.\n",

    "analysis": "The Colts' offense put on a middling performance but Taylor had no problem breaking a handful of long runs versus the Dolphins. His highlight of the day was a 23-yard touchdown run in the first half. Taylor also caught all three of his targets for 11 yards. Marlon Mack earned a surprising 10 carries after being shopped on the trade market all week. Despite his boost in volume, Taylor backers shouldn't be concerned. He entered the game with a knee injury and the bulk of Mack's work came in the closing minutes of the game. Taylor remains an RB1 versus the Ravens next week.\u00a0\n",

Weird game to read into. It's worth noting that Zack Moss was the first back on the field and that he had five red zone carries to Singletary's one.

    "analysis": "Barkley was the X-factor this afternoon, jump-cutting like he was back to 100 percent health and scoring two of the Giants' three touchdowns. The first was a 54-yard reception where some play-calling deception got Barkley free down the left sideline. He then looked a wide receiver with his speed making the house call. Barkley's second score was a walk-off, six-yard rush in overtime. He took a read option and got real skinny through the hole, making an excellent cut. There were a few times where Barkley seemed like he was trying to do too much \u2014 including spinning into a fumble the Giants thankfully recovered \u2014 but he continued his trend of looking more explosive each week. The Giants' awful line is going to lead to some volatility, but Barkley is already deserving of being a weekly fixture in the RB1 ranks, including Week 5 against Dallas.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Edmonds took advantage of closeout mode to post the second most rushing yards of his career and third most yards from scrimmage. The biggest play was Edmonds' 54-yard scamper on a 3rd-and-7 from the Cardinals' own four-yard line with 10:35 remaining. Edmonds continued to look like the Cardinals' most dangerous back, but James Conner remained the preferred option in the red zone, cashing in a pair of one-yard carries for touchdowns. Conner has enough playmaking ability to provide weekly RB2 returns on 12-15 touches, but his ceiling will be capped as long as Conner gets to keep extending the ball beyond the plane. The Cardinals are hosting the 49ers for Week 5.\u00a0\n",

Elliott also out-touched Tony Pollard 20-10 and saw the Cowboys' lone backfield target. A workhorse in one of the league's most potent and explosive offenses, Elliott will again be ranked as a top-five option against the Giants in Week 4.\n",

Rodney Smith's usage in the receiving game came out of left field, though, out-targeting Hubbard 5-2 in what was essentially a blowout game script for the entire fourth quarter; having registered four of his five targets while the Panthers were trailing by two scores, it's possible Smith was only in the game for that reason. It didn't help that Hubbard was also vultured by his own quarterback inside the red zone, seeing Sam Darnold plow ahead for 11- and one-yard rushing scores. Hubbard will still rank as a touch-based RB2 against Philadelphia in Week 5 given the injury-riddled landscape of his position.\n",

    "analysis": "This came after Gruden noted that Josh Jacobs was questionable for the Raiders' Monday Night game versus the Chargers. Jacobs is dealing with an ankle injury but appeared to return to practice on Thursday. It's safe to assume that Gruden will only ride Barber if Jacobs is inactive, despite his glowing comments on the journeyman runner. Barber tallied 23 carries and five targets in the Raiders' Week 3 win. They'll be underdogs against Los Angeles which will ensure Barber doesn't log 26 touches again but he could be in line for RB2 numbers if Jacobs can't go. Kenyan Drake saw 11 touches last week and is nothing more than a deep FLEX option.\n",

    "analysis": "Pollard's most impactful play was a meaningless one in the box score, moving the chains with an option lateral from Ezekiel Elliott (20/143/1) on 3rd-and-1 to ice the game. Pollard was still out-carried 20-10 on Sunday and failed to see a single target behind Elliott in the passing game. Still averaging 11 touches through four games, Pollard's outlook as a standalone RB3/4 remains the same. He can be fired up again as such in Week 5 against the Giants.\n",

Hopefully Jones is dealing with \"just\" a high-ankle sprain, but an injured reserve stint appears inevitable. There has not been as much work as expected behind Kamara, so Washington is not worth an immediate add in 10-12 team leagues.\u00a0\n",

For the 20-yarder, Williams separated from Mike Hughes and caught a bullet Justin Herbert had little time to unload. For the game-winner, Williams again got the better of Hughes. Sitting in the Chargers' highly-profitable \"X\" receiver spot, Williams is up to 22/295/4 through three games. That is WR1 production. The Raiders are a WR1 matchup for Week 4.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

His 67 yards were actually his most since Week 1, however, which tells you all you need to know about his limited production to begin the season. Hopkins has not scored since Week 2 and is averaging 56 yards. His rib issue has surely played a part. He will have a woefully-undermanned 49ers secondary to feast on for Week 5, keeping him in the WR1 ranks.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "After missing Week 3 with a knee injury, Johnson was all systems go in this one, commanding 30% of the targets on 40 Ben Roethlisberger throws. Johnson scored the passing offense's lone touchdown with a 45-yarder on a free play in the first quarter to cap the opening drive after the Packers jumped offside. Johnson has seen target counts of 10, 12, and 12 in his three games this year. He's a bankable WR2 as the Steelers' clear top wideout ahead of a Week 5 date with the Broncos.\n",

He was also stopped at the one-yard line on a target inside the 10 during Carolina's second possession, setting up the first of Sam Darnold's two rushing scores on the day. With double-digit targets in three consecutive games, Moore's volume is in no danger of disappearing any time soon \u2014 especially with Christian McCaffrey (hamstring) sidelined for the next 2-3 games. Moore will again rank as a low-end WR1 in Week 5 against the Eagles.\n",

Even if you give him no credit for that easy score, he still topped 20 PPR points on the day. Samuel has emerged as the clear top pass-catcher in San Francisco, even surpassing George Kittle in the pecking order. He has led the 49ers in targets every week this year and now has at least 90 receiving yards in three of four games. His quarterback for Week 4 is up in the air as Jimm Garoppolo missed the second half with a calf injury but it looks like nothing will be stopping Samuel anytime soon. He'll continue to vie for WR1 numbers in a shootout with the Cardinals next week.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Although Kadarius Toney led the Giants in targets, Golladay paced the Sterling Shepard, Darius Slayton-less receiver corps in production. 28 of Golladay's yards came on a huge grab near the end of regulation where he broke a tackle to tack on major yardage to get the G-Men in field goal range. Golladay was called for a first half OPI penalty, but it was by far his best effort as a Giant. The question is if he will see enough looks for WR2 value once Shepard is back from his hamstring issue. We wouldn't count on it, especially with Toney emerging. The first-round pick was a point of emphasis for Daniel Jones and play-caller Jason Garrett this afternoon. Golladay will be in the WR28-34 range for Week 5 vs. Dallas. He could see a heavy dose of breakout second-year pro Trevon Diggs.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

With Tua Tagovailoa out until Week 6 at least, Parker may continue to be reliant on garbage time with Brissett under center. His Week 4 outing was reassuring but he can only be trusted as a WR3 versus the Bucs next week.\n",

As the WR2 for a team struggling to mount much of a passing attack, Pascal is nothing more than a WR5 versus the Ravens next week.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Woods' first score since Week 1 came in the deepest recesses of garbage time, with the Rams trailing 37-13 with 1:14 remaining. He remained an afterthought as the game was decided, entering the fourth quarter with two targets. He did manage to draw a DPI on the final play of the third period, but Woods was simply buried behind slot dominator Cooper Kupp and role player Van Jefferson. We would like to think Woods remains a no-brainer positive regression candidate, but a quarter of the season is now in the books and he has 15 total grabs for 172 yards. Another alarm will be added to the fire if he has a quiet night against the Seahawks' shaky defense on Thursday Night Football.\u00a0 \u00a0\n",

Although Bryan Edwards' 89 yards led the team in Week 3, Ruggs' seven targets tied Darren Waller (5/54) for a team-high mark. Ruggs continues to be the better stash in fantasy over Edwards if nitpicking among the team's receivers in deeper leagues.\n",

Will Fuller left with a hand injury and did not return, opening the door for Waddle to see an increased role next week.

Third-string RB Rodney Smith was the next closest on the team with five targets. Assuming his increased volume remains consistent without McCaffrey, Anderson can be started with confidence as a WR3 in next week's tremendous matchup against the Eagles.\n",

Higgins is tentatively expected to return for Week 5, so this receiver corps will return to being a three-man ordeal. Boyd can hopefully count on boosted volume for that matchup, as the Bengals are going to have to throw more often against the Packers.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Lockett once again took a backseat to DK Metcalf, who led the team with eight targets. After blowing up for 278 yards and three touchdowns in his first two weeks, Lockett has cooled considerably over the past two. He has 55 yards in the previous two weeks combined. Seattle has played at a snail's pace this year and chose to lean on the run in this game, resulting in low receiving stats across the board. In games where their competition puts up a better fight, the Seattle pass-catchers should see far more targets on the whole. That projects to be the case next week as the Seahawks host the Rams on Thursday. Look for a rebound from Lockett if that game lives up to its shootout potential.\u00a0\n",

Brown made up for his disastrous Week 3 performance against Detroit, when he dropped three potential touchdowns and appeared bewildered on the sideline. Game script wasn't friendly to Brown in Week 4. The Ravens got conservative in the second half with a comfortable lead against a Denver offense led by Drew Lock. As Lamar Jackson's trusted downfield threat, Brown should have FLEX appeal in Week 5 against the Colts.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Callaway's 74 yards were a new season high by 33, but it is still difficult to get too excited when the production came on only two targets. Callaway also injured his ankle at the end of a 58-yard grab in the third quarter but remained in the game after getting taped up. The Saints need to funnel more deep shots Callaway's way, but coach Sean Payton is understandably petrified of Jameis Winston turning the ball over. The Washington Football Team is a positive Week 5 matchup, one that will create opportunities down the field.\u00a0\n",

Edwards' five targets, matching his career-high from Week 1, finished tied with Barber for fifth on the team as the sophomore continued making more of an impact on the field than in fantasy lineups.

Kittle has more than doubled his target total from the first two weeks of the season in his previous two contests.

With 33 targets through three games, Waller will still be considered a matchup-proof top-three option at his position next week against Derwin James and the Chargers.\n",

The TE2 dream remains alive, but you don't need us to tell you this is still a limited-ceiling player.\u00a0\n",

Uzomah scored on plays of 22 and 31 yards, looking hard to take down in the open field on both occasions. For the first, he caught a perfectly-lofted ball from Burrow on a jailbreak screen. For the second, he got open on a scramble drill and rumbled down the field. The Bengals could certainly use more production from the seam, but tonight hardly seems likely to be the start of a TE2 trend for Uzomah. He does have a plus Week 5 matchup in a Packers defense surrendering the third most tight end fantasy points through three weeks.\u00a0\n",

With Carolina needing secondary help after losing Jaycee Horn indefinitely to a foot injury, the Panthers made the move, dealing Arnold to Jacksonville. The Jags lost James O'Shaughnessy (ankle) for at least a few weeks and started journeyman TE Jacob Hollister Sunday against Arizona. Arnold should immediately step in as the team's top pass-catching tight end in an offense that made\u00a0O'Shaughnessy fantasy viable for the season's first couple weeks. Arnold has flashed when given the chance. He had seven catches for 84 yards in three games with the Panthers. Rookie Tommy Tremble -- who caught a 30-yard pass and scored on a short rushing attempt in Week 3 -- profiles as Carolina's pass-catching tight end after Arnold's departure.\u00a0The Darnold-to-Arnold era was short lived.\n",

    "analysis": "Gesicki kept the game alive with a one-yard score in the fourth quarter but the Miami offense was unable to keep up with Jacoby Brissett under center. He finished second on the Dolphins in targets and first in receptions, edging out DeVante Parker by one catch. After a catch-less Week 1, Gesicki has rebounded with no fewer than three receptions and 41 yards in his subsequent games. The Miami offense has looked uninspiring under Brissett but the tight end position falls off precipitously after a few elite options. Gesicki's role makes him a low-end TE1, even with the recent downgrade in quarterback play.\u00a0\n",

The Bills will roll with Knox and\u00a0Tommy Sweeney as their top-two tight ends entering the regular season. Hollister, who had intermittent fantasy relevance in two years with the Seahawks, will land on a roster. It's also possible, as noted by The Athletic's\u00a0Joe Buscaglia, that the vested veteran is re-signed by the Bills following final cuts. This move would help the Bills avoid season ending IR for an injured player. Hollister\u00a0had four catches for 53 yards in three preseason games this month.\n",

McPherson is the favorite in the team's kicker competition with veteran Austin Seibert, who has also impressed coaches and beat writers this month. The Bengals offense is among the league's most kicker friendly. Last season, Randy Bullock was fantasy's third highest scoring kicker when Joe Burrow went down with a season-ending knee injury. Fantasy managers should consider McPherson if the game's top kickers are off the draft board.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "The bespectacled Blankenship, a fantasy revelation last season, survives the training camp battle with Pineiro, who did not miss a kick in the preseason and, according to Colts beat writers, kicked well throughout August. There was some buzz in the first week of August that Blankenship's job was in real danger a year after he logged the fifth most field goals in the NFL. The Colts attempted the fourth most field goals in 2020 -- a key factor in Blankenship's fantasy usefulness. There's no reason to reach for Hot Rod in 2021 drafts, though you could do worse than the second-year kicker in the final round of redraft leagues.\u00a0\n",

Buffalo tried out kickers Matthew McCrane (Kansas State), Tristan Vizcaino (Washington), and Ramiz Ahmed (Nevada). Bass, who made a meager 20 of 28 field goal tries last year at Georgia Southern, would make a decent fantasy option in Week 1. Buffalo is a 6.5-point home favorite against the Jets.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "As Over The Cap pointed out on Twitter, 29-year-old Santos has been cut five times since 2018. To say it's an aggressive move would be putting it mildly. The Bears were simply overjoyed by Santos' competent 2020 after years in the kicker wilderness. Santos converted 93.8 percent of his 2020 field goal tries, boosting his career mark to 83.1. Santos is not called on very often from 50-plus yards, making him an extra unlikely recipient of this kind of contract. There's a chance this deal could quickly become an albatross.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Fantasy football's No. 2 kicker in 2020 is cashing in on a profoundly efficient season in which he made 36 of 39 field goal attempts, banging through all 36 of his extra point tries. He established himself as one of the league's big-footed kickers by nailing eight of nine kickers over 50 yards. Sanders' extension includes a $10 million guarantee. His 2020 numbers stand in stark contrast to his 2019 stats, which include seven missed field goals on 30 attempts. Only the Cowboys and Falcons attempted more field goals than Miami in 2020, giving Sanders the opportunity necessary to become a waiver wire darling in fantasy. Sanders will probably be one of the most over-drafted kickers in fantasy football next season.\u00a0\n",
