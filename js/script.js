He hasn't been the problem at all for the Bolts, who continue to find ways to lose games. The Chargers got all the way down to the four-yard line at the end of the game and opted to call back-to-back low-percentage end-zone fades that were tough to complete. After the refs initially ruled a game-winning touchdown, replay overturned it and the Chargers lost again. Herbert's two touchdowns that counted were hookups with Keenan Allen and Gabe Nabers. Herbert will be a QB1 next week at the Dolphins.\n",

    "analysis": "The Bills never bothered with the running game against the Seahawks' astonishingly bad defense and Allen rewarded them with a first half where he went 24-of-28\u00a0for 282\u00a0yards and three scores. For his first touchdown, Allen found a wide-open Isaiah McKenzie for a perfectly-lofted 25-yarder. He added a one-yarder to Tyler Kroft and four-yarder to Gabriel Davis. On Davis' score, Allen lunged forward like he was going to run before fading away like he was Tim Tebow at Florida. It was a thing of beauty. Allen didn't have to do quite as much after halftime, but he added two more touchdowns, the second of which was a three-yard rushing score where he followed a caravan of blockers into the end zone. Today was a badly needed effort from a player in a smash spot who had been in a slump. Mission accomplished, to put it mildly. Allen will look to stay hot against Arizona's bending but not breaking defense in Week 10 before heading on bye in Week 11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n",

Although Miami's man-to-man blitzkrieg allowed the team to strip-six\u00a0Murray on Arizona's opening possession, he constantly took advantage of corners having their backs turned to the line of scrimmage in scampering for a career-high 106 yards including the go-ahead 12-yard touchdown mid-third quarter.

Rodgers' MVS strikes came after the maddening deep threat dropped an easy third down conversion early in the second quarter. That drew a Rodgers glare, but the quarterback hit his stone-handed wideout for a wide-open 52-yard score late in the first half. Rodgers appeared to barely move his feet before launching a missile along a perfect arc. Needed for very little after the break, Rodgers rested the final five minutes. Rodgers has now delivered three or more scores in five of his past six starts, and six times on the season. He should easily stay scorching against the Jaguars in Week 10.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

This was a truly legendarily bad performance from the third-highest paid player in the NFL. Goff was destroyed by Emmanuel Ogbah on a 78-yard fumble-six on one of the turnovers, and he very easily could have thrown three or four more interceptions that Dolphins defenders flat-out dropped. Eric Rowe should have had a walk-in pick-six in the second half. With the Rams taking a run-heavy approach in 2020, the 61 pass attempts marked Goff's first game of more than 38 attempts this year. The 5-3 Rams obviously prefer to hide their quarterback and will get the bye week to regroup ahead of a Week 10 date with the Seahawks in L.A.\n",

His first cough up was especially uncharacteristic, as Wilson climbed the pocket without feeling the rush from behind. Severely out-dueled by Josh Allen in the first half, both of Wilson's passing scores came after the break. The first was an insane 55-yard strike to David Moore in the end zone after Wilson was flushed to his right and found Moore running uncovered. The second was a seven-yarder to DK Metcalf. Wilson's turnovers have shot up as the defenseless Seahawks find themselves in increasingly frenetic shootouts. The Seahawks have two games in the next 11 days, visiting the Rams in Week 10 before hosting the Cardinals for Thursday Night Football in Week 11. Wilson will be the QB1 overall both times out in the rankings.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

Coach Matt Nagy's play-calling shoulders some of the blame as the team comically tried to move the sticks with David Montgomery (14/30) and Cordarrelle Patterson (3/13) on multiple 3rd-and-short scenarios, additionally drawing two flags for false starts when trying to convert on 4th down in the second half. This offense is an utter disaster, but Foles may still be able to salvage his day in garbage time for the second straight week against\u00a0the Vikings next Monday night.\n",

Wentz said he's \"going to have to watch the tape and I\u2019m a little frustrated with how I played and how we\u2019ve left some plays out there, left some points out there, and missed some big opportunities.\" No one this season has thrown more interceptions than Wentz, who has bailed out fantasy managers with rushing production time and again. Eagles head coach Doug Pederson said there \"was never any of that conversation to pull him\" Sunday night despite the poor play. Jalen Hurts should be rostered in all superflex leagues in case Pederson tires of Wentz's disastrous decision making and rolls with the rookie in the season's second half.\u00a0\n",

The Panthers called a bunch of screens to Christian McCaffrey and hit on countless shallow crossers to Robby Anderson (13 targets), Curtis Samuel (9), and D.J. Moore (3). Bridgewater's best two plays were runs, a sign that his leg injury is not limiting him much at this point. The Panthers offense is well-coached and has enough fire power to lead Bridgewater into the high-end or mid-range QB2 conversation. Reaching those levels against the Bucs in Week 10 will be a moderate but doable challenge.\n",

Evans played\u00a0an unusually high 17 snaps\u00a0from the slot Sunday against the Saints with Antonio Brown in the Bucs lineup for the first time -- usage that could keep his fantasy production afloat in Tampa's crowded receiver group.\u00a0\n",

Brown (4/101/1) to put the team up 10-0 in the first half. Tannehill's\u00a0second touchdown came in the fourth quarter on a two-yard strike to Jonnu Smith. This game didn't offer much opportunity for Tennessee's offense since the Bears and Nick Foles didn't hold up to their end of the bargain on offense, but Thursday's upcoming matchup against the Colts could prove to be much more voluminous for Tannehill. He'll be ranked as a low-end QB1 in that one.\n",

Gamescript was also a factor, as Gibson has just one third down touch all season, and Scott Turner clearly trusts McKissic in the passing game as Alex Smith's outlet. We now search for great ground game matchups for Gibson and Sunday is one on paper versus the Lions. It would be a shame if he missed it, as there might not be many left.\n",

Ryan Nall caught four of four targets and scored a touchdown in Montgomery's absence against Tennessee, and\u00a0Cordarrelle Patterson had three rushes and four catches.

Lindsay rushed eight times after entering the week with a toe injury. Gordon was also only targeted once. The Broncos are on the road next week and could end up as underdogs to the Raiders. If they are unable to keep up with the Las Vegas offense, it could be another difficult day for Gordon. He\u00a0projects as a low-floor RB3 next week.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "He added two catches for 46 yards on two targets in the passing game, hanging a total of 252 yards on Detroit. He was steadily picking up 8-10 yards on what seemed like every carry. Cook's day could have been even bigger, but he was stuffed on a second-and-goal carry from the one-yard line before an Irv Smith one-yard score the next play. Cook's first touchdown was a five-yard scamper that was initially ruled down at the one. His second busted the game wide open from 70 yards out early in the fourth quarter. Over the last two weeks, Cook has totaled 478 yards and six touchdowns against the Packers and Lions. The NFL's leading rusher now, Cook has scored in every game this season and gets a road date with the Bears in Week 10.\n",

Joshua Kelley played more snaps than Ballage but saw 14 touches to Ballage's 17. It's clear there's no scenario in which Kelley gets a full workload for LA. Depending on the severity of Jackson's injury, Ballage could have low-end RB2 value in Week 10 against his former team, the Dolphins.\u00a0\n",

His 10-yard catch in the third quarter did help setup Kyler Murray's 12-yard touchdowns scamper to put the Cardinals up 31-24. Although Edmonds' final box score lacks pop, fantasy players should take solace in the fact he handled 25-of-26 running back carries and 28-of-30 backfield touches without Kenyan Drake (ankle). Assuming Drake sits for a second consecutive game, Edmonds will again rank as an RB1 in Week 10 against the Bills if only for his salivating usage.\n",

Jacobs' per-carry numbers weren't great in this one, and he was out-rushed 68-65 by Devontae Booker, who saw eight carries, but Jacobs was playing through a minor knee issue and illness. He added a three-yard catch in the pass game. Jacobs will be an RB1 next week in a home date with the lowly Broncos.\n",

    "headlineNews": "Devin Singletary rushed twice for one yard in the Bills' Week 9 win over the Seahawks, adding three receptions for 33 additional yards.\u00a0\n",
    "report": "",
    "analysis": "This was a catastrophic outcome for Singletary, who handled the ball just five times as the Bills scored 44 points and ran 64 plays. It was game-plan specific against the league's worst pass defense, but Singletary still got out-carried 9-2 by Zack Moss, not to mention 7-2 by Josh Allen. Both Moss and Allen found the end zone on the ground. Singletary's FLEX argument is rapidly deteriorating as he does little more than accrue low-calorie fantasy yardage between the 20s. The Cardinals are on deck for Week 10 before the Bills' Week 11 bye.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Robinson was held to one catch for four yards in the first half as Nick Foles whiffed in his direction on multiple tries. Robinson's\u00a023-yard catch over S Kenny Vaccaro unsurprisingly helped the Bears get on the board for its first points of the game with 12:33 remaining in the fourth quarter. Foles' poor play under center can be directly attributed to the fact Robinson hasn't scored or eclipsed the century mark since Week 4. He'll again rank as a middling WR2 stuck in an unfavorable situation in Week 10 against the Vikings.\n",

The latter didn't even record a target in the first half, merely getting one opportunity to collect a downfield DPI through the first two quarters. This performance can be thrown out altogether as Hopkins will again rank as a WR1 in Week 10 against the Bills.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Brown's first highlight-reel reception, a play-action crosser that he grabbed\u00a0and bounced upfield off Eddie Jackson for a pile of yards after the catch, helped the Titans grab the game's\u00a0first lead. He later helped cement that lead\u00a0with a 40-yard slot fade that Ryan Tannehill dropped in a bucket along the sideline. Brown's volume was a concern coming into the year, but he's consistently shaken those doubts off with seven targets and/or a receiving score in every game this season. Brown is a weekly matchup-proof WR1 for the rest of the year.\n",

Kyle Allen was lost to a gruesome ankle injury in the first quarter, and McLaurin's day seemed to be going nowhere fast until he turned a simple Alex Smith crossing route into a 68-yard touchdown with 10 minutes remaining. Smith got him much more involved thereafter, including targeting McLaurin on his game-ending interception. It was an awful pass from the quarterback. Conservative Smith's presence will be a concern going forward, but Washington is catching an easy three-game slate of @DET, vs. CIN and @DAL. McLaurin will remain in the low-end WR1 mix.\u00a0\n",

Moore's efficiency remains at career-high levels, but he's settled in as a boom-bust WR3. The Bucs are another tough test.\n",

The Bucs' pass defense is another challenge, but Anderson has earned WR2 trust in almost all matchups.\n",

    "analysis": "The squeaky wheel did not get the oil in Week 9. Brown, in a since-deleted tweet, complained about his usage in the Baltimore offense last week after seeing two targets against the Steelers. Lamar Jackson threw a meager 23 passes Sunday against Indy, so no Ravens pass catcher was going to see volume. He now has fewer than five receptions in four games this year, and has two touchdowns through nine weeks. That Brown came into Week 9 with the 12th most air yards among wideouts is cold comfort for fantasy players who drafted Hollywood with visions of spike weeks dancing in their heads. He'll be a touchdown dependent WR3/4 play in Week 10 against the Patriots.\u00a0\n",

Samuel's upside is evident, but it's still hard to trust his floor after a very slow beginning of the season. Samuel will be a classic boom-bust flex play against the Bucs who many consider to be a top-three defense.\n",

This, as DK Metcalf once again cruised past 90 yards with 7/108/1. The dud also came as Russell Wilson passed for a season high 390 yards. Consistency just seemingly is not Lockett's thing. On pace for 106/1,230/14 at the year's mid-way point, Lockett won't hurt for blow-up games in the second half of the season, but we might not always see them coming. The Rams in Week 10 will be the Seahawks' toughest matchup in a while.\u00a0\n",

With 18 targets in Chicago's last two games, Miller is suddenly on the radar as a high-floor WR4 moving forward. Next week's matchup against the Vikings should offer little pushback for 6-8 targets.\n",

That was admittedly his only real shot at getting on the board since Ryan Tannehill primarily\u00a0peppered\u00a0A.J. Brown (4/101/1) throughout\u00a0play. It was a return-to-Earth moment for Davis after he had seen 10 targets in back-to-back games. Fantasy players should expect performances similar to this one (rather than\u00a0his past two starts) more often than not moving forward. He'll rank as a WR3/4 on Thursday night against the Colts.\n",

    "analysis": "Engram is now up to 29 targets over his past three games. True to form, despite the volume and touchdown, it was not a perfect day, as one of Engram's missed connections was just begging to be an interception. It was a perfect pass that Engram batted up into the air for a near pick. Thankfully for the Giants, the Washington defender could not \"complete the process.\" Engram has turned those voluminous recent looks into 155 yards since Week 7. That gets you into the TE1 mix this year, but ceiling remains almost nonexistent with Engram playing mistake-prone ball with an erratic Daniel Jones. The Eagles are up next for Week 10.\u00a0\n",

He ultimately did little once taking the field again. Fant dealt with an ankle injury earlier in the year so he could be dealing with a re-aggravation of that ailment. Fant should be started in all fantasy leagues but this injury may reduce his effectiveness going forward. The Broncos face the Raiders in a solid passing matchup next week which should help Fant get back on track.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Witten spent 16 seasons with the Cowboys from 2003-2019. The most-recent version of the veteran TE wasn't all that great, as Witten set career-low marks in both yards per reception (8.4) and yards per target (6.4) in 2019. The fit with the Raiders is even more puzzling considering the presence of both Darren Waller and Foster Moreau. It's unlikely that Witten sees enough targets and snaps to work as a standalone fantasy option in 2020, but his presence undoubtedly lowers the ceiling of both Waller and Moreau.\n",

The problem for Reed is that three of them belonged to Dwelley. We would assume that Reed, who was playing well before landing on injured reserve with a knee injury, will probably take the going forward targets lead over Dwelley, but Dwelley remaining involved in any fashion would kneecap Reed's TE2 value catching passes from Nick Mullens. Reed has 10 days to rest up for a Week 10 date with the Saints before the 49ers' bye.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Alexander hasn't played since Week 5 because of an ankle injury, but he had yet to land on injured reserve, suggesting a return is imminent. Viewed as a questionable high-dollar free agent signing last year, Alexander missed half the 49ers' Super Bowl campaign before being activated during the postseason. He was not playing well this season before the trade, but this isn't the first time the Saints have made a \"change of scenery\"-type acquisition\u00a0on defense over the past few seasons. In theory, 26-year-old Alexander still offers upside on all three downs, but his career has mostly been an injury-plagued, inconsistent mess.\u00a0\n",
