Playing on a short week after turning the ball over seven times across his past two starts, Wilson was more contained as the Seahawks dialed up 31 rush attempts. It was a badly needed reset from the 'Hawks, who surprisingly got after Kyler Murray on defense and just tried to keep the game in front of them on offense. The sub-200 yard passing effort was Wilson's first of the season, though he has now provided multiple scores in 9-of-10 starts, with the lone exception being last week's dismal loss to the Rams. For fantasy managers worried a more restrained Seahawks could become the norm down the stretch, they have a series of excellent matchups, beginning with the Eagles on 11 days rest in Week 12. Wilson will still be a top-three quarterback every week out.\u00a0\n",

There was just nothing that could be done in weather conditions that created a 37-minute delay to start the game. Watson had a number of throws that probably could have been caught but were not perfect passes because of the conditions. Speaking to that point, his 16-yard touchdown strike to \u2014\u00a0we are not making this up \u2014\u00a0Pharaoh Brown\u00a0looked like it may have been intended for Will Fuller, but the wind put Brown in better position.

He was finding Travis Kelce over the middle and Tyreek Hill over the top for chunk gain after chunk gain.

    "analysis": "With the Steelers winning 36-7, Roethlisberger got a rest for the final 10 minutes. Today was Big Ben's first four-touchdown effort of the season. He found each of his big three of Diontae Johnson, Chase Claypool and JuJu Smith-Schuster for scores, including\u00a0Claypool twice near the goal line. Roethlisberger's deep ball still left a little bit to be desired, but it was crisper than it has been at times this year. He found Johnson for a beautiful 46-yard strike down the left sideline. Despite his seemingly diminished arm strength, Roethlisberger has been as decisive as ever this season. He's also wily, freeing Claypool for TD No. 1\u00a0with a pump fake to Eric Ebron. Week 11 opponent Jacksonville boasts one of the league's worst pass defenses before tougher matchups with Baltimore and Washington.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

Their rushing attack faced little resistance from Denver toward the end of the game so there was little need for Carr to drop back. He could have left the game with a touchdown but Darren Waller dropped a deep pass from Carr that would have been a walk-in touchdown. This is his third consecutive week under 200 yards. He faces the Chiefs next week so it's unlikely that his team will get to run on a massive lead to close out the game. Carr enters low-end QB2 territory in the more competitive matchup.\n",

    "analysis": "It was a quiet night for Murray coming off his signature day against the Bills, one seemingly made quieter by a first quarter play where he got his throwing shoulder crunched. Murray could be seen wincing as he warmed up on the sideline, and his passes did not quite have their usual zip the rest of the way. Facing surprising pressure/blitzing from the Seahawks, Murray had trouble connecting with DeAndre Hopkins, finding him for a modest 5/51. His scores went to Dan Arnold and Chase Edmonds, with the latter being in the face of an all-out blitz from the three-yard line. The story going forward will be Murray's shoulder. He seems unlikely to miss any time since he played through the issue for three quarters tonight, but Sam Darnold sat under similar circumstances earlier this season. Murray has 10 days to get right for a road trip to New England.\u00a0\n",

Big Ben settled in, but Burrow had a difficult time even once the conditions slackened. The majority of his yardage came before halftime. He seemed to be favoring his ankle a bit in the second half as the Steelers' pass rush absolutely teed off. Burrow was lucky to escape with \"only\" four sacks. He was definitely lucky to have zero turnovers, not that he was making poor throws. Burrow did seem somewhat confused by the Steelers' coverages after the break. It was a lowlight game in a season where the No. 1 overall pick has not had many of them. The schedule stays tough, with Washington on deck followed up by the Giants and Dolphins.\u00a0\n",

Goff wasn't a difference maker in the pocket, but he distributed the ball evenly to his weapons and consistently marched down the field. The yardage was nice, but all three of the touchdowns came on the ground. When everything is clicking, coach Sean McVay wants to lean on the run, limiting Goff's overall fantasy appeal. Things could get trickier if stud LT Andrew Whitworth (knee) is ruled out for the year. Goff facing the blitz-heavy Bucs on the road without his blindspot protector next week smells like trouble.

Washington was forced into a pass-heavy game script after falling behind 14 points in the first half. The Lions' obliged with two and a half quarters of soft zone coverage that allowed Smith to rack up chunk plays. Before fantasy managers get excited about Smith as a streaming option, they should remember Smith is rarely -- if ever -- going to drop back and throw it 55 times. He'll be a solid superflex option in Week 11 against the Bengals' middling pass defense.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "This was by far Flacco's best game of the season across three spot starts. With the Patriots minus Stephon Gilmore on the back end, Flacco was picking on fill-in J.C. Jackson and veteran Jason McCourty on the outside. Flacco hit Breshad Perriman for a 50-yard touchdown over the top of Jackson in the second quarter, and then found Jamison Crowder behind McCourty for a perfectly-placed 20-yard toe-drag swag just before the half. Perriman later whooped Jackson again in the third quarter for a 15-yard score. But it was Flacco's fourth-quarter interception on the first play of one possession that gave the Patriots life to erase a 10-point deficit. The Jets ran just four plays in the fourth frame, going three-and-out on their other drive. Sam Darnold (shoulder) should be back after the bye to face the Chargers in Week 11.\n",

Drake appeared in danger of not finishing the game after needing to get his left ankle re-taped, but he didn't end up missing any time. Drake now has 10 days to heal up for a date with the Patriots' slow run defense. Fantasy managers badly wanted the Drake/Chase Edmonds status quo to change, but it just isn't happening.

Booker scored twice in the fourth quarter. Jacobs also added four catches for 28 yards on four targets. Jalen Richard left the game with a chest injury and Booker only saw one target. The loss of Richard could mean more work in the passing game for Jacobs but Booker may take on the role going forward. Jacobs remains one of the league's best backs between the tackles and his team is winning a majority of their games. Unfortunately for Jacobs, Las Vegas gets the Chiefs next week. They managed to pull off the upset the last time the two faced but that shouldn't be the expectation. Even if game-script doesn't go Jacobs' way, he should be able to push for 20 touches next week and remains an RB1.\n",

FOX color analyst Matt Millen kept talking up Kareem Hunt as the more decisive, quicker back today, but it was still Chubb who emerged victorious in awful weather conditions. Of course, Hunt did hold the rushing production advantage until the Browns' final non-kneeldown snap, where Chubb was free for a 60-yard touchdown ... until he went out of bounds at the one-yard line to ice the game and clock with 0:53 remaining. An absolutely brutal development for fantasy managers was a smart real life decision. The touchdown that Chubb did score was a nine-yarder where he cut back across the entire defense. As Millen fixated on, Chubb certainly appeared rusty, but he did seem healthy. With his sea legs back underneath him, he will remain a clear-cut, high-end RB1 for Week 11 against the Eagles.\u00a0\n",

Active for the first time since Week 7, Hyde got the start with Chris Carson (foot) still on the shelf. The Seahawks were ready to move on from DeeJay Dallas/Travis Homer/Alex Collins and Hyde made it easy, ripping a number of nice early gains as the Seahawks \"established the run\" for one of the only times all season. It clearly took pressure off Russell Wilson coming off two turnover-marred disasters. This should not and will not be for the formula for the Seahawks going forward, but it made sense on a short week in the context of their past two games. Hyde's going-forward value will be entirely dependent on Carson's health, who has 11 more days to get cleared for Week 12 Monday Night Football vs. Philadelphia. Hyde will be a barely-there FLEX if Carson suits up.\u00a0\n",

    "headlineNews": "Jonathan Taylor rushed seven times for 12 yards in the Colts' Week 10 win over the Titans.\n",
    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Taylor seems to be setting new lows weekly at this point. After fumble-sixing against the Ravens last week, his seven carries were third on the Colts in a game they won convincingly by 17 points, and his 12 yards were a new season worst. Taylor was stuffed on a third-and-goal from the one-yard line in this one. He just runs too high at times, and that was particularly the case on that specific carry. Jordan Wilkins (8-28) wasn't much better in this one, but both were behind Nyheim Hines, who totaled 115 yards and recorded a season-best 12-70-1 rushing line. Taylor looks like the third man in this backfield committee. Frustrating as ever, Taylor is approaching drop status in 10- and 12-team leagues ahead of a Week 11 date with the Packers.\n",

With two receptions for two yards, Gurley has now been held under three catches in six of eight games this year. He remains a touchdown-dependent RB2 but his usage in high-leverage situations makes him one of the best bets to find the end zone every week.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "We wouldn't normally bat an eye at a Wednesday DNP with \"illness,\" but we can't take anything for granted in the year of COVID-19. Now that Johnson is back at practice, the bigger concern is his initial ineffectiveness\u00a0on the ground in place of David Johnson (concussion). He is going to have to show more against the Patriots' soft run defense this week if he is to avoid the Buddy Howells of the world beginning to mix in for touches. Duke is a plug-and-play RB2 for Week 11 despite last week's poor showing in Cleveland.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

Conner has been held under 50 yards rushing in three straight games, the latter two of which were A+ matchups. He is offering very little as a pass catcher. Circumstance keeps suggesting Conner will be an RB1, but it is not happening in practice. The Jaguars are yet another great spot for Week 11.\u00a0\n",

The good news for FLEX desperados is that Edmonds found the end zone, catching a wide-open three-yard strike as Kyler Murray fended off an all-out blitz. After his one-game starting flop, Edmonds has resumed operating as a highly efficient, productive change-of-pace back. It is pretty clear at this point that the Cardinals are not going to change it up. With bye weeks over in Week 12, Edmonds' FLEX case will take bit of a hit with the league back at full strength.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Gordon now has 25 carries in his past three games combined, all of which saw the Broncos take an early deficit. He exited early in the game with an apparent ankle injury but returned shortly after and didn't seem to be hampered by the injury. The good news for Gordon is that he only ceded six carries to Phillip Lindsay and Royce Freeman including the touches they racked up on his one missed drive. He needs his team to stay competitive to be a viable fantasy option and that may not be the case versus Miami next week. Gordon is a low-floor RB3 option moving forward.\u00a0\n",

Even as the Colts' pass-game specialist, Hines looked like the only Colts running back capable of converting a first down against Tennessee. While Taylor and Wilkins were blown up on several goal-line runs, it was Hines who punched in a two-yard touchdown in the third quarter after diving in for a 13-yard receiving score earlier in the night. Hines has three two-touchdown games to his name this season but zero scores in the other six\u00a0contests. Hines looks like the better of the three Colts' backs right now, but he's a low-floor RB3/FLEX most weeks but gets a plus date with the Packers in Week 11.\n",

McFarland, who saw touches in Week 8 before Snell, seems to have passed Snell in the rushing pecking order. He's a savvy pickup in deeper formats.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Thomas now has seven catches for 73 yards in two games back from his nagging hamstring and ankle injuries. It's hardly what Thomas drafters had in mind when they got their first round pick back. Jameis Winston, who could start Week 11 for the Saints after Drew Brees suffered a rib injury, missed Thomas twice -- once badly. Perhaps a high-scoring back-and-forth Week 11 game against the Falcons will be enough to inflate Thomas' target volume. He should remain in fantasy lineups despite the lack of production.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Claypool led the Steelers in Week 9 targets, but his 10 looks today were actually third behind JuJu Smith-Schuster (13) and\u00a0Diontae Johnson (11). For score No. 1, Claypool high-pointed an 11-yard pass at the goal line late in the third quarter. For No. 2, he ran a simple in route at the goal line, hauling in a five-yard strike to put the Steelers up 36-7 with 10:31 remaining. Up to a ridiculous nine scores in nine games, Claypool also received a carry from the Bengals' five-yard line in the second quarter, but he got knocked for a three-yard loss. Looking more and more uncoverable, Claypool has Ben Roethlisberger's undivided attention in the red zone. That keeps him locked in as a WR2 even in a crowded receiver corps where the targets can be a bit unpredictable week to week.\u00a0\n",

Thielen caught both of Kirk Cousins' touchdowns versus the Bears but Jefferson led the Vikings in targets. He's a high-end WR2 going forward.\n",

The nine catches matched Smith-Schuster's season high, with the 13 targets one off. Despite that prodigious\u00a0volume, Smith-Schuster has still yet to have a 100-yard day, and is averaging less than 10 yards per catch. Diontae Johnson and Chase Claypool get all the deep work in this offense, with Johnson a targets hog and Claypool a red zone magnet. That conspires to keep Smith-Schuster as a low-end WR2. All three have plus Week 11 matchups in the Jaguars.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

Pittman's long gain of 40 yards was on a fourth-quarter catch-and-run. He also rushed one time for 21 yards. Pittman has seen 15 targets over the last two weeks and looks like someone who needs to be added in 12-team leagues for the stretch run.

    "analysis": "The passing game wasn't it for the Texans today, as it was not an effective means of moving the ball in windy Cleveland. Cooks' 39 yards were by far his fewest since Bill O'Brien's firing. Cooks has been a WR1 since BOB was sent packing, but he should settle in as a mid-range WR2 for the season's stretch run. The Patriots are an approachable Week 11 matchup.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "After seeing just three targets in Week 9, Moore was responsible for two massive plays in Week 10. The first was a rainbow vertical shot by Teddy Bridgewater against the blitz, which Moore worked back to and caught with defenders closing. Then Moore took a tunnel screen 24 yards for a touchdown, aided by an amazing kick-out block by LT Trent Scott. Moore nearly had another 40-yard gain to his name, but it was later reviewed and rescinded just before halftime. Moore's volume seems to be more scattered than Robby Anderson and Curtis Samuel each week, but he has big-play potential that is difficult to leave outside of the top 30 WRs.\n",

Don't expect much to change coming out of the Week 10 bye, although the Cowboys should have a chance for points against the Vikings in two weeks. Gallup is a WR5.\n",

The explosive rookie flashed what he's capable of after the catch and could begin to pop for bigger gains down the stretch. It's worth holding expectations in check while the offense figures things out, but Reagor belongs on the flex radar during bye weeks. Philly heads to Cincinnati in Week 11.\n",

He would have walked into the end zone untouched had he caught it. Waller may struggle in games that his team dominates their opponent but that won't be the case next week versus the Chiefs.

The most targets Rudolph had seen in a game this season up to this point were four. Once Smith returns, Rudolph will likely lose all of his recently-gained fantasy value.\n",

    "analysis": "Witten spent 16 seasons with the Cowboys from 2003-2019. The most-recent version of the veteran TE wasn't all that great, as Witten set career-low marks in both yards per reception (8.4) and yards per target (6.4) in 2019. The fit with the Raiders is even more puzzling considering the presence of both Darren Waller and Foster Moreau. It's unlikely that Witten sees enough targets and snaps to work as a standalone fantasy option in 2020, but his presence undoubtedly lowers the ceiling of both Waller and Moreau.\n",
