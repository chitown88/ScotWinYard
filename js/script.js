Metcalf in the end zone twice for scores of four and two yards. Things died down for the Seahawks in the second half, but they afforded themselves enough of a cushion to hold on. Wilson got back on track with elite efficiency, posting a 70.0 completion percentage and 9.1 YPA. He'll look to keep it up against the Buccaneers' weak secondary in Week 9.",

        "analysis": "The final line is a mixed bag from a fantasy perspective, but Winston was downright bad at times Sunday in a real-world football sense and was guilty of an inexcusable four turnovers. The mistake-prone quarterback did have the connection with Mike Evans in top form, as he hit his trusted wideout for 11 completions, 198 yards and a pair of touchdowns from nine and two yards out, respectively. Winston's second pick was particularly ill-timed, as it came at the Titans' 25-yard line with 26 seconds remaining, effectively sealing the Buccaneers' fate. Coach Bruce Arians had emphasized heading into the bye week that he hadn't considered benching Winston, but a second straight multi-interception effort and third consecutive game with sub-55.0-percent passing might lead to a reevaluation of that statement. Winston's next opportunity to right the ship comes Week 9 against the Seahawks.",

Jones had four touchdowns compared to nine turnovers in his previous four games, so this outstanding effort was a pleasant surprise to fantasy owners who were brave enough to start him this time around. He'll now turn his focus to next Monday's home matchup against the Cowboys.",

Turnovers continue to be an issue for Rivers, who has coughed up the ball nine times through eight games.

Obviously, Trubisky hasn't been a solid fantasy option this year, as he's thrown touchdown passes in just two games while his rushing yardage has mostly evaporated from what he produced in 2018. Should he eventually lose the starting job, Chase Daniel would be a slight upgrade for fantasy owners. For now, Trubisky's downside makes him a risky player to trust in fantasy lineups.",

Jones has made significant strides as a receiver this season, nearly doubling his aerial output from last season in four fewer games. The third-year back has seen his rushing production take a hit, averaging 4.1 yards per carry after gaining notice in fantasy circles with a 5.5 average over his first two seasons.

The Broncos were forced to punt and watch a game-ending opposing field goal for the third time this season. Lindsay echoed quarterback Joe Flacco after the game that he wished the offense was a little more aggressive. The point is fair, but Denver has also struggled to find any sort of rhythm regardless of situation. Lindsay has been a rare bright spot, with at least 75 total yards in four of his last six games and four touchdowns. Something to watch in the coming weeks will be Lindsay's role in the passing game with Emmanuel Sanders now in San Francisco. Lindsay's five catches Sunday were a season high.",

        "analysis": "Building on an ongoing trend, Howard dominated the volume on the ground while Miles Sanders was more effective as a receiver out of the backfield. Sanders actually had a 65-yard touchdown run himself but left in the third quarter due to a shoulder injury. Howard also watched third-stringer Boston Scott vulture a four-yard score in the third, but the lead back then found the end zone from three yards out himself in the fourth. The former Bears workhorse has five rushing touchdowns in his last six games, and Howard could be in for a larger workload against his former Bears teammates in Week 9 if Sanders is forced to miss additional time.",

Still, this was arguably the 26-year-old's best game since the aforementioned return, as he showed off his trademark elusiveness on a 19-yard touchdown scamper in which he changed direction on a nifty backdoor cut to find space. With the Chargers' offensive line in shambles, it's hard to have any sort of confidence in Gordon returning to last year's form, one that saw him average 5.1 yards per carry. However, he's a capable red-zone threat in an offense that has been able to move the ball despite difficult matchups such as Sunday's.",

The team is taking the field at Levi's Stadium on Tuesday evening, but Breida won't be out there. \"If we had to go today, it wouldn't be good,\" Shanahan added about Breida. Wednesday's injury report will reveal Breida's game-day status, but it seems like there's potential for him to sit out Thursday at Arizona. Such a scenario would bump Jeff Wilson into the backup spot behind Tevin Coleman.",

        "report": "Interim coach Bill Callahan said Friday that he's hopeful Thompson (toe) will be ready to play in the Redskins' Week 9 game against the Bills, John Keim of ESPN.com reports.",
        "analysis": "Thompson was inactive for a second straight game in Thursday's 19-9 loss to the Vikings, with the quick turnaround for the Week 8 contest never making it likely that he would be able to suit up. With a few additional days of prep time ahead of the Nov. 3 game in Buffalo, Thompson should have a better chance at overcoming his bout with turf toe, but his availability for the contest will likely hinge on what he's able to do in practices next Wednesday through Friday. Once Thompson is cleared to play again, Wendell Smallwood will drop back to third on the depth chart at running back and will likely see most of his playing time on special teams.",

Allen's numbers were fairly pedestrian considering the Bears' increasing focus on covering underneath routes, but the two-time Pro Bowler likely should have a touchdown reception early in the fourth quarter on an excellent deep pass, only for the sure-handed receiver to simply drop it, setting up what would be a 42-yard missed field goal. Allen figures to be in a better spot come next week when he faces a Packers' defense that has proven to be susceptible to the pass in recent weeks.",

Though not particularly deep, the reception was Hilton's longest of the season by nine yards. The veteran target has been a different kind of player with Brissett at quarterback, more of a catch-and-run option than the deep threat he once was (and appears still could be). His modest 11.3 yards per catch this season would be a career low by almost two full yards, but he's getting it done in the red zone like never before, with five touchdowns at the halfway point, just two away from tying a career high.",

Up next for Jeffery is a date with the team that drafted him in the second round back in 2012, as the Bears will come to town Week 9.",

Stills is seemingly still reliant on big plays for fantasy production despite an elevated role in the passing game, and this should remain the case next Sunday against the Jaguars in London.",

        "analysis": "Samuel had a quiet day as a receiver, but he was able to do some damage as a runner. Coach Kyle Shanahan dialed up the same jet sweep play for his rookie wideout on both carries, and Samuel cut his second attempt back inside and hit paydirt for the second time in six games. Usual starter Marquise Goodwin missed Sunday's contest for personal reasons, so new acquisition Emmanuel Sanders took his spot in the starting lineup, but it was Samuel -- and not Dante Pettis -- who started opposite the veteran. The latter had started every game he has been healthy for up until this point, so this could signal a change in the depth chart moving forward. It will be interesting to see who ends up starting alongside Sanders against the Cardinals on Thursday (assuming Goodwin is available), but it appears that Samuel will occupy one of the three primary WR slots.",

It is no secret that Pettis has been a colossal disappointment in his sophomore season. From having his motivation questioned by his head coach in the preseason, to poor statistical results despite technically being a starter (10 catches for 88 yards and a touchdown over seven games), there isn't a positive takeaway from his 2019 campaign so far. In fact, following the acquisition of Emmanuel Sanders earlier this week, there was a report that Pettis could be dealt before Tuesday's trade deadline, according to NFL Insider Adam Caplan. A trade to a more pass-happy offense could be the recipe he needs to tap back into the potential the 2018 second-round pick displayed last season, but if he sticks in San Francisco, Pettis will not carry much fantasy value heading into Thursday's matchup against the Cardinals.",

        "analysis": "Williams led the team in receiving yards, but a badly dropped touchdown on a deep pass in the first half likely ruined what could have been a breakout game for the 25-year-old. Quarterback Philip Rivers' lone interception came on what would probably count as a misplay by Williams, as the third-year receiver didn't come back to an errant pass far enough, resulting in cornerback Kyle Fuller jumping in front of the misguided pass attempt. Still, it seems as if Williams is knocking on the door of a fantasy outburst each week, and he should have more opportunities next week against a Packers secondary that has struggled to stop the pass in recent weeks.",

The 25-year-old was coming off of a huge 133-yard performance, so Sunday's dud will leave a sour taste in fantasy owners' mouths. Valdes-Scantling was expected to take over top receiving duties while Davante Adams (toe) remains sidelined, but the wideout is averaging just 1.5 receptions and 2.8 targets in four games as a starter. It is unclear whether Adams will be able to return for Sunday's matchup against the Chargers, but even if he doesn't, expectations for MVS should be kept in check against a defense that is more susceptible to the run (21st-ranked defense) as opposed to the pass (5th).",

It didn't work out that way as Hamilton was held catchless for the third time this season and was even edged out in offensive snaps by Fred Brown, 46 to 45. The Broncos seem as though they will fill the void Sanders left behind by throwing it more to Courtland Sutton and the backs and tight ends, namely rookie Noah Fant. That would place Hamilton as no better than third or fourth in the pecking order in an offense that has looked horrid and will give Brandon Allen the first start of his career Sunday against Cleveland.",

While fantasy owners should still keep in mind that Amendola seems to have a low floor in this offense -- he caught just five of seven targets for 43 yards in three games from Week 2 through Week 6 -- it's possible the chest injury that forced him to miss one of those games played a role in that lowly output. In any case, it's clear that Stafford is becoming rather fond of the veteran wideout, and there's plenty of reason to believe the pair could have another productive outing Week 9 against the Raiders.",

Jones logged 22 offensive snaps against the Texans, which placed him behind fellow receivers Tyrell Williams, Hunter Renfrow and Trevor Davis as expected. A similar level of involvement should be on tap for Jones in Week 9 against the Lions, who could be without starting defensive backs Darius Slay (hamstring) and Tracy Walker (knee).",

With 261 receiving yards and half the season in the books, the 2015 first-round pick is well off even the 700-yard pace that had become his baseline over the last two seasons. With the Bears on tap Week 9, it's tough to foresee the 26-year-old bucking that trend in the near future.",

For this one game, the Texans partially made up for the absence of Will Fuller (hamstring) by allocating more opportunities to their tight ends, while Keke Coutee did not even get off the sideline. Halfway through the season, Akins has already matched his catch and target totals from all of 2018. Unfortunately, he evenly shares the position with Fells, and fantasy owners are rolling the dice any given week when selecting either one.",

While some low-usage tight ends still carry value by stealing the occasional touchdown, Sprinkle has not seen a red-zone target in four consecutive games and has been targeted there just twice this season. With the way this Washington offense is rolling, he seems to be a terribly play against a typically stingy Buffalo defense.",
