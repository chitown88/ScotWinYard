The embattled second-year signal-caller wasn't exactly efficient through the air, but he was taken down only once by the typically ferocious Steelers pass rush and connected with Jarvis Landry and Stephen Carlson for one- and eight-yard touchdown passes, respectively. Mayfield also opened the scoring on the night with a one-yard touchdown sneak in the first quarter, only his second rushing score of the campaign. Mayfield now has back-to-back multi-touchdown efforts and will look to keep his solid play going in a favorable matchup against the Dolphins in Week 12, a week from Sunday.",

The QB came out firing in the third quarter, converting his next seven passing attempts for 46 yards and a touchdown to Jacob Hollister. However, with a 21-10 lead in hand, the six-time Pro Bowler coughed up a fumble that DeForest Buckner returned for six to bring the 49ers back into the game. Wilson came up clutch at the end of OT, as he ripped off an 18-yard run and completed three passes for 15 yards to set up Jason Myers' game-winning field goal. The Seahawks have closed the gap in the NFC West and are 8-2 heading into their bye week.",

    "analysis": "Jackson once again was in excellent form both through the air and on the ground, posting his second straight game with multiple touchdown passes while also eclipsing the 80-yard mark as a rusher for the fifth time on the campaign. He continued to flash the considerable improvement he's managed to make as a passer, with Sunday marking his third consecutive contest with a 70.0 percent completion rate. The second-year signal-caller spread the ball impressively as well, hitting nine different pass catchers overall on the afternoon. Having helped the Ravens to an impressive 8-2 record, Jackson will look to stay hot versus the Rams in a Monday night Week 12 matchup on the road.",

He also connected with Will Fuller on throws of 44 and 51 yards, which helped him to come within two yards of his fourth 300-yard effort of the campaign on a relatively modest 19 completions.

    "analysis": "The rookie signal-caller put forth his best pro performance against the Jets' bottom-10 pass defense, leading his team to two fourth-quarter scoring drives and snapping a streak of 19 consecutive quarters without a Redskins touchdown. Haskins may be able to settle into a rhythm and provide some late-season utility in fantasy, especially with Washington expected to be trailing in a high percentage of games and thus forced to throw the ball with greater frequency. The chief obstacle to Haskins' success will continue to be the Redskins offensive line, however, as the Washington front five has surrendered 3.2 sacks per game thus far this season. Week 12 presents an opportunity for Haskins to build upon his solid outing against the Jets, as the Redskins prepare for a home game against a Lions defense that surrendered 444 passing yards to Dak Prescott and the Cowboys offense Sunday.",

The fourth-year quarterback's passing yardage total served as a season low for him in a non-injury-shortened game, and it was his second straight sub-200-yard effort overall while playing all four quarters. Hilton was on a snap limit of sorts Thursday -- which certainly didn't help Brissett overall -- but he also failed to connect with two of his other wideouts, Marcus Johnson and Zach Pascal. Brissett did manage his third rushing touchdown of the campaign with a five-yard score in the latter portion of the second quarter, but he'll look to significantly boost his passing production at the expense of the Titans in Week 13.",

    "analysis": "The second-year signal-caller was the victim of the most flagrant conduct of the fight, as Browns defensive end Myles Garrett pulled Rudolph's helmet off the quarterback and then swung it at Rudolph's head. Garrett received an indefinite suspension for his actions, while Browns defensive tackle Larry Ogunjobi and Steelers center Maurkice Pouncey were handed one- and three-game suspensions, respectively. Though Rudolph avoided a suspension, the NFL will presumably review the video of the fight and determine whether the 24-year-old did anything to warrant a fine. In the meantime, Rudolph will look to move past an outing that was already an ugly one leading up to the fight. Rudolph finished the night with 23 completions on 44 attempts for 221 yards, a touchdown and a career-high four interceptions.",

The quarterback made the comeback more difficult with his two picks, one a terrible toss in the red zone, but he still put together a phenomenal performance, especially considering George Kittle (knee) was inactive and Emmanuel Sanders (ribs) was clearly less than 100 percent. Garoppolo's carelessness with the ball remains a concern, as he's thrown at least one INT in eight of 10 games this season, but his 18 TD passes have helped make up for it -- although eight of them have come in his two games against the Cards, who he won't get to face again this year.",

On the next play, Winston tossed his third of four interceptions on the day, with Marcus Williams taking the pick back 55 yards to the house. Because his practice reps remained intact Wednesday, Winston's health doesn't appear to be a question. On the other hand, he's thrown multiple picks in four of the last five games and leads the NFL with 18 interceptions, making him a risky play on a weekly basis.",

To be sure, Derrick Henry did much of the heavy lifting during Sunday's upset, but Tannehill has been the perfect complement to Tennessee's formula of pounding the ball and playing solid defense and he's now 3-1 as a starter.

    "analysis": "Jones had to do all the heavy lifting for Big Blue's offense in this one, as Saquon Barkley and Wayne Gallman combined for only three rushing yards on 14 carries. The rookie quarterback was up to the task for the most part, tossing a pair of second-quarter touchdowns to Darius Slayton and two third-quarter scores to Golden Tate. He hit Bennie Fowler for a two-point conversion after the fourth touchdown, giving his team a 27-21 lead at the time. Unfortunately for Jones, his fumbling issues also continued, as he has now put the ball on the ground 10 times in the past four games. The Giants will surely try to address those issues during their Week 11 bye.",

    "analysis": "Sunday's primetime matchup featured two teams committed to running the ball to quash the opposition's pass rush, and while the Rams were far more successful in achieving that goal, it led to an unsavory fantasy line for Goff. The 25-year-old has really struggled since coming out of the bye week, completing just 55.9 percent of his passes with no touchdowns and three picks over a two-game span. In Goff's defense, the Steelers and Bears are two of the tougher teams to throw on this season, and he should have a far easier go of things against a Ravens defense on Monday Night Football that ranks in the bottom third of the league in terms of limiting opposing quarterbacks.",

    "analysis": "The Broncos relied heavily on trickery early Sunday and it paid dividends, with Denver jumping out to an early 17-0 lead courtesy of a couple of big throws by Allen, including a 48-yarder to Courtland Sutton. When archaeologists dust off this game to see what went wrong, however, they'll find back-to-back drives to end the first half in which Allen airmailed a pass to Sutton to settle for a field goal and then was picked on his second try. The big early lead still gave Allen a shot to pull it out at the end, but the young quarterback was unable to connect on back-to-back-to-back attempts to end the game. The shine has already worn off a bit for Allen after just two games, and, while he is almost guaranteed to start against a very good Buffalo defense Sunday, the clock should start on Drew Lock Watch in December, assuming the rookie is activated off of injured reserve after suffering a preseason thumb injury.",

    "analysis": "Any doubts about whether Kareem Hunt would eat into Chubb's lead-back workload were put to rest for at least one more game, as the latter logged a season-high workload. Chubb frequently found running room at a premium against a stingy Steelers front, but he did enough to help keep the chains moving and crossed the 90-yard threshold for the sixth time this season. While Hunt's role figures to continue expanding over the season's remaining games, Chubb will head into a highly favorable Week 12 matchup against the Dolphins a week from Sunday as the top backfield option for Cleveland.",

While he was targeted only twice in the passing game, he converted both into catches and capped the performance with a 21-yard gain through the air. Though he hasn't been as effective as a receiver as in season's past, Bell now has surpassed 30 receiving yards in three consecutive games.

The insertion of Ryan Tannehill has the Titans 3-1 over their last four games. In that span, Henry has logged 416 rushing yards and five total touchdowns, matching his output in Marcus Mariota's six starts. Following Tennessee's bye, Henry will be tested against a Jacksonville defense that held him to 44 yards and a touchdown on 17 carries in Week 3.",

If Peterson and Thompson are active, the development could hinder Guice's usage. With just Peterson to contend with this past Sunday versus the Jets, Guice earned 28 percent of the offensive snaps en route to seven carries for 24 yards and a 45-yard catch-and-run for a TD.",

However, Hunt was a major part of the passing game for the second time in as many games since returning from his season-opening suspension, leading the Browns in receptions and checking in second only to Odell Beckham in receiving yardage. Head coach Freddie Kitchens appears set on sticking with Chubb as his clear-cut lead back for the moment, but Hunt should continue seeing his role in the offense expand with each successive game. His next opportunity to up his production will come in a favorable matchup against the Dolphins in Week 12, a week from Sunday.",

    "analysis": "Faced with an excellent matchup against one of the worst run defenses in the league, Elliott fumbled on his first touch and could only manage 2.8 yards per carry. He did, however, record a one-yard TD run in the second quarter and added the decisive score on a 17-yard reception midway through the fourth. Although Elliott failed to take full advantage of an excellent opportunity for a breakout game, his two scores were a boon for fantasy owners, and the passing offense continued to flourish. This could eventually mean more room to run for the star tailback, whose next opportunity will come Sunday against the Patriots.",

    "analysis": "Before the NFL handed him a four-game suspension earlier this month in connection with his three offseason arrests, Walton had seemingly separated himself from Ballage as the Dolphins' lead back following the late-October trade that sent Kenyan Drake to Arizona. Walton was expected to reclaim the top spot on the depth chart once eligible to return Dec. 8 against the Jets, but he lost his roster spot entirely after Miami was made aware of his involvement in yet another \"police matter\" early Tuesday. While Walton's dismissal aids Ballage, his pitiful efficiency this season (1.9 yards per carry on 64 totes, 3.8 yards per reception on 13 catches) may have already put his standing in the backfield on shaky ground. Rookies Patrick Laird and Myles Gaskin now loom as the remaining challengers at running back, and both could see increased chances in the weeks to come if Ballage continues to struggle in both the running and passing games.",

Perhaps the Rams' underwhelming 5-4 record forced coach Sean McVay to lean on his best offensive weapon after it appeared that he was trying to conserve his star back in order to avoid another postseason breakdown like we saw in 2018. The 25-year-old proved that he can handle a heavy workload and post an elite stat line, and perhaps this game is a sign that McVay is ready to take off the training wheels and unleash Gurley on the league down the stretch. We will get a chance to see what kind of workload last season's top fantasy back can sustain against the Ravens in a Week 12 Monday night battle.",

    "analysis": "Montgomery was a game-time decision after rolling his ankle at practice earlier this week, but he was able to suit up and lead the team in carries. Unfortunately for his fantasy owners, the rookie was unable to do much against the Rams' stout interior defensive line, and he may have also been feeling the affects of the balky ankle. Despite the dud, Montgomery has been averaging 18 carries over his last four contests, and he will have a chance to feast against the Giants -- which allow 122.7 rushing yards per game -- on Sunday.",

The play itself was encouraging, but fantasy managers would be justified in being concerned that Freeman was kept to single-digit touches for the second consecutive game after at logging at least 10 in the first eight contests of 2019. Even with Phillip Lindsay playing well, it's somewhat of a surprise that Freeman hasn't been more involved in the passing game, perhaps a product of Joe Flacco's (neck) absence. The workload between Lindsay and Freeman will obviously be worth monitoring in Week 12 against Buffalo.",

The second-year pro didn't see the field after that whiff. Chris Carson also fumbled the football (the Seahawks recovered), but it was clear he had a longer leash than Penny by recording 28 touches. Penny will look to get back into the coaches' good graces in the team's next game Nov. 24 against the Eagles.",

    "analysis": "Hopkins was likely due for some touchdowns after recording only four over his first 10 games, but it was the way he got in the end zone Thursday that was particularly eye-catching. Hopkins crossed the goal line from 35 and 30 yards in the second and fourth quarter, respectively, the latter score proving to be the difference in the contest. The multi-time Pro Bowler clearly seemed to benefit from the return of speedy teammate Will Fuller (hamstring) to the lineup, as Hopkins was able to exploit what appeared to be man coverage on his pair of touchdowns. He'll look to continue thriving in a particularly tough matchup versus the Patriots in a Week 13 showdown, a week from Sunday.",

He sat out practice Wednesday before returning as a limited participant Thursday and Friday, sporting a no-contact jersey to avoid any aggravation of the issue. Coach Kyle Shanahan said he views Sanders, Deebo Samuel (shoulder) and George Kittle (knee/ankle) as game-time decisions for Sunday's 8:20 p.m. ET kickoff, but it sounds like the 32-year-old wideout is confident he'll be able to play. It's a bit less clear where Samuel and Kittle stand, though Jennifer Lee Chan of NBC Sports Bay Area expects both pass catchers to play.",

He snagged a second touchdown off of a tipped pass in the fourth quarter. The performance featured Brown's third-highest yardage total of his career and only his second multi-score game. It also helped him to new season highs in targets, catches, yards and touchdowns, and he topped 100 yards for the first time since Week 1. Next up is a top-five Denver pass defense that was burned by Minnesota late in Week 11.",

Given that Ridley has averaged nearly 6.5 targets per game on the season, it's fair to say that workload has been less of a concern than yardage and scoring production. Since amassing 169 receiving yards and two touchdowns between Week 1 and 2, he had eclipsed 75 receiving yards just once over the ensuing seven outings. Despite his boom-or-bust nature, Ridley's upside remains immense given Atlanta's upcoming matchup against a Tampa Bay defense that has surrendered 14 combined passing touchdowns over its past four games.",

    "analysis": "It was Courtland Sutton versus the Vikings in the first quarter as the sophomore brought down a 48-yard pass in double coverage and drew a 24-yard pass interference to set up Denver's first touchdown, before completing a 38-yard pass to Tim Patrick and having a nifty nine-yard run to set up a touchdown on the next drive. The Broncos continue to be middling under center, but Sutton looks like a legitimate stud on the outside. A tough matchup against Buffalo awaits Week 12, but Sunday's loss almost definitely ensures that big-armed rookie Drew Lock (thumb) will be under center at some point in the coming weeks, which could help Sutton's cause.",

    "analysis": "Fuller managed to make it back from a three-game absence and have a major impact on the Texans' air attack, even as in true Fuller fashion, he also suffered an injury scare on one of his big plays. Fuller appeared a bit gimpy on his balky hamstring after notching a 51-yard grab in the third quarter, but he remained in the game and finished with the second-highest reception and receiving yardage totals of the season. Fuller also notched a 44-yard grab during the third period, and his presence and success seemed to loosen up the secondary for DeAndre Hopkins, who recorded a pair of rather atypical 30-yard-plus touchdown receptions.  Fuller will look to continue getting healthier ahead of a Week 13 showdown versus the Patriots, a week from this coming Sunday.",

    "report": "Robinson caught four passes (six targets) for 15 yards in Sunday's 17-7 loss to the Rams.",
    "analysis": "Robinson spent most of his night matched up against shutdown corner, Jalen Ramsey, and the defensive back got the better of the matchup. The Bears' top wideout has now posted two rough outings of 15 yards and six yards over his last three contests, but a lot of the blame can be placed on inconsistent quarterback play from struggling third-year pro Mitch Trubisky. Robinson won't have to deal with a corner anywhere near as talented as Ramsey when Chicago takes on the Giants (24th ranked pass defense) on Sunday, and he should remain startable in most formats with 8.6 targets per game this season.",

Sandwiched in between those performances is a one-catch, six-yard dud, as the 22-year-old wide receiver is still striving to find week-to-week consistency. Slayton makes for an intriguing pickup moving forward given the upside he's displayed recently, but his role could shrink dramatically if Sterling Shepard (concussion) is ready to make his return following the Giants' Week 11 bye.",

    "report": "Samuel caught four of seven targets for 25 receiving yards during Sunday's 29-3 loss to Atlanta.",
    "analysis": "When it comes to Samuel's value, the equation for verifying whether he was a worthwhile start in a given week boils down to whether or not he got into the end zone. In four contests this season in which Samuel has scored a touchdown, he has accounted for four receptions and 55.5 yards per game. In six outings without a score, however, he's been held to just 3.7 receptions and  40.7 yards, while only exceeding the 50-yard mark once. The workload has been there to justify him as a weekly starting consideration (7.5 targets per game), but Samuel's catch rate of 50.7 percent severely inhibits his ability to consistently contribute to a winning fantasy operation. In Week 12, he'll be saddled with a discouraging matchup, going up against a New Orleans defense that entered Sunday as a top-12 unit in both passing yards (225.8) and passing touchdowns (1.3) allowed per game.",

The Rams leaned heavily on Todd Gurley and its rushing attack in order to slow down the Bears' vaunted pass rush, which caused Jared Goff and company to finish with poor fantasy numbers all around. Kupp produced well considering he only received a season-low three targets, but that is now two consecutive fantasy clunkers (zero catches last week) coming off the team's bye. Look for Kupp to get back on track Monday against a Ravens team that is easier to move the ball on through the air.",

The 24-year-old responded with his third consecutive game with a receiving touchdown. Undrafted in 2017, the wideout has proven to be more reliable than receivers on the team with a higher pedigree, keeping him in the top three on the wide receiver depth chart ahead of the likes of Dante Pettis and Marquise Goodwin. Bourne's 6-foot-1 frame has earned him looks in the red zone, and he is cashing in on those opportunities with flying colors.

Still, the Baltimore passing game funnels through Mark Andrews and Marquise Brown. No one else in the offense has a target share greater than 11 percent.

The tight end was a limited practice participant Thursday and Friday, earning a 'questionable' designation on the final injury report after he was 'doubtful' (and didn't end up playing) the past two weeks. An 8:20 p.m. ET kickoff may be nerve-racking for fantasy managers, leaving just two games to choose a tight end from if Kittle is declared inactive. The list of potential replacements is led by 49ers teammate Ross Dwelley, Packers TE Jimmy Graham and Rams TE Gerald Everett, while lower-end options include Nick Boyle and Hayden Hurst from the Ravens or Tyler Higbee from the Rams.",

    "analysis": "It's interesting that Hockenson wasn't in the starting lineup even though Detroit opened the game in a two-tight-end formation, but the rookie nonetheless wound up with his second-highest snap share of the season before the final whistle. The issue for him Sunday was that he just didn't see many passes come his way, as Hockenson also finished the game having seen his second-fewest targets of the year. There's optimism for a modest bounce-back effort Week 12 against Washington, but it's hard to imagine there being much upside for Hockenson as long as Matthew Stafford (back) is out of service.",

    "analysis": "The veteran tight end was more than a \"safety blanket\" option for his young quarterback Kyle Allen in Week 11, tearing off gains of 15 and 26 yards in the passing game -- the second of which helped set up Carolina for its only score of the afternoon. Olsen is starting to look like the matchup-winning option he proved to be early on in the season, combining for 13 catches and 155 yards over his past two outings after averaging just 2.5 receptions and 27.5 yards per game between Weeks 4 and 8. Upcoming next for Olsen is a matchup against a Saints defense that surrendered 10 catches for 73 yards to Tampa Bay tight end Cameron Brate on Sunday.",

Howard appeared to have secured a short pass at the Buccaneers' 17-yard line before somehow causing it to become airborne and landing into in the waiting arms of Saints linebacker Demario Davis to set New Orleans up with excellent field position. Howard's disappointing season is seemingly a microcosm of the team's as a whole, as the athletic third-year pro came into the campaign with high expectations and yet has fallen short of delivering more often than not. Howard will look to put Sunday's forgettable performance behind him against the division-rival Falcons in Week 12.",

    "report": "Hollister and Tyrone Swoopes are the only healthy tight ends on the Seattle roster for Sunday's game in Philadelphia, Brent Stecker of 710 ESPN Seattle reports.",
    "analysis": "Swoopes was promoted Friday from the practice squad after Ed Dickson (knee) was sent back to injured reserve. A few hours later, the Seahawks listed Luke Willson (hamstring) as doubtful on their final injury report, setting up a situation where Hollister's snap share could stretch even higher than the 80 and 78 percent he saw in his past two games. He took full advantage of those opportunities to the tune of 12 catches for 99 yards and three touchdowns on 16 targets, picking up where Will Dissly (Achilles) had left off in earning Russell Wilson's favor near the goal line. The Eagles have given up the seventh-fewest receiving yards per game to tight ends (41.9) and generally have played well on defense in recent weeks, but there's a lot to be said for simply take a large number of snaps in an offense with Wilson at the helm.",

His long catch of the day went for 48 yards, with Sam Darnold finding him wide open along the sideline. Just one play later, he hauled in a 16-yard pass to find the end zone for his fourth touchdown of the season. Given Chris Herndon's (rib) placement on injured reserve, Griffin should be in a good position to serve as the team's top receiving tight end option for the remainder of the campaign. He'll also have a strong matchup in Week 12, as the Jets will draw a suspect Raiders defense.",

    "analysis": "Fant and Brandon Allen had some nice moments Sunday, with a 31-yard shot downfield on the opening possession and a clutch 11-yard completion over the middle to convert a fourth down on Denver's final drive. The issues came in the red zone, as Allen threw behind Fant for a red-zone interception just before halftime and the two were unable to link up on either of Allen's end-zone attempts to Fant on the team's final drive. Despite the misses, Fant appears to be trending upward, even with Tim Patrick offering some more stability at WR2. The rookie is averaging 7.3 targets per game over his last four contests, and, given his ability to get create mismatches, he's always in play for some downfield shots each week. Next up in Week 12 is a Bills defense that has been particularly adept this season at keeping opposing receivers in front of them.",
