He added an eight-yard touchdown to Mark Andrews in the fourth quarter but got picked off twice after that to dim Baltimore's comeback hopes before connecting for a 50-yard score with Willie Snead in garbage time. While Jackson has made strides as a passer, he's still much more comfortable operating with a run-pass balance, though big deficits open up the possibility of fantasy-friendly garbage-time production. Jackson remains a high-tier fantasy quarterback ahead of a Week 5 trip to Pittsburgh."

Playing a Detroit defense that has frustrated a Pro Bowl's worth of quarterbacks already this season, Mahomes wasn't playing pitch and catch as he typically does and was held without a touchdown for the first time since Week 5 of last season. Sunday showed that Mahomes is mortal; it just so happens that mortal -- for him -- still includes 369 total yards."

        "analysis": "For the second time in four days, Goff's right arm put in plenty of overtime. The fourth-year quarterback now has 117 pass attempts in the last pair of contests following Thursday's hefty workload, one once again largely necessitated by the stumbles of the Rams' defense. Goff connected with seven different pass catchers on the night and showed outstanding chemistry with tight end Gerald Everett, who racked up a game-high 136 yards. Goff also had to endure the early exit of Brandin Cooks, who left the game for good in the second half to be evaluated for a concussion. Ultimately, Goff put the Rams in position for a narrow win by spearheading a 10-play, 67-yard drive that set Greg Zuerlein up for a would-be game-winning 44-yard field goal that went wide right with 11 seconds remaining. In the wake of back-to-back crushing losses, Goff and his teammates will look to regroup ahead of a Week 6 divisional clash versus the 49ers a week from Sunday."

In a contrast to last week, Rivers had plenty of time to survey the field. He routinely hit the aforementioned targets underneath, or particularly in Inman's case, on back-shoulder fades, while easily marching down the field. It won't be smooth sailing in Week 5, however, as the Broncos' vaunted secondary travels to Los Angeles."

Rodgers otherwise thrilled the Lambeau crowd throughout the contest, shining with touchdown passes to Jimmy Graham and Geronimo Allison, as well as with 10 completions for 180 yards to Davante Adams. The perennial Pro Bowler's ill-timed pick was his first of the season, while Rodgers' 46 rushing yards were easily a season-high figure.

That mistake aside, Winston constantly was a step ahead of coordinator Wade Phillips' defense, showing particular chemistry with Chris Godwin, who overcame a hip injury to connect with Winston for 12 completions, 172 yards and two touchdowns. Winston also showed a propensity for answering when the Rams drew closer, hitting Mike Evans on a perfectly executed stop-and-go route for a 67-yard score early in the fourth quarter to extend Tampa's lead to 45-27 at the time.

        "analysis": "The Eagles predictably leaned on the running game in this contest, as the Packers' secondary had shown considerable improvement over last season across the first three games. However, with the ground attack working to the tune of 159 combined rushing yards from Jordan Howard and Miles Sanders, the Green Bay defense was kept honest enough to enable Wentz to find occasional success when dropping back. The fourth-year quarterback hit two of his banged-up pass catchers, Alshon Jeffery and Dallas Goedert, for second-quarter touchdown passes, and he subsequently connected with Jordan Howard for a 20-yard scoring toss in the third quarter. Wentz now has multiple touchdown passes in three of the first four games of the season, and although Thursday's yardage tally was his lowest of the campaign, the 26-year-old did remain free of interceptions for the third contest of the season as well. Having played an integral role in the Eagles evening their record at 2-2, Wentz will turn his sights to building up his numbers against the Jets in a Week 5 battle a week from Sunday."

Tennessee also proved capable of breaking Ryan's long-standing touchdown streak, an 18-game run dating back to Week 2 of last season in which he threw at least one touchdown in every game and averaged 2.4 touchdown passes per contest.

        "analysis": "After the Seahawks' first two drives, it looked like it would be a long night for Wilson, as he was constantly on the run from a stout Rams' defensive front. However, he made adjustments, and on the third drive he rolled out to his left, patiently waited for his moment and lofted a pass where only Tyler Lockett could catch it for the game's first touchdown. Wilson ended up throwing three more scores, including a game-winner to Chris Carson with 2:28 remaining in regulation. He finished the contest with a season-high 11.7 yards per attempt, and this was the fourth time in five games he completed over 70 percent of his passes. Wilson will look to continue his efficiency in Week 6 versus the Browns."

Therefore, it's tough to really gauge how the team will operate their two-headed backfield. The third-year back has been incredibly productive as the leading ballcarrier for the Chargers, posting 220 rushing yards and 270 receiving yards along with six touchdowns through four games. However, head coach Anthony Lynn made it known Gordon would resume his lead-back role as soon as the team deemed him physically ready, which could occur as early as Week 5 against the Broncos."

A positive takeaway for Zeke's fantasy owners would be that the back garnered 100 percent of Dallas' running back carries. The 24-year-old is still the workhorse of the backfield even with backup Tony Pollard (zero touches) blowing up for 100-plus yards last week.

Kamara's only shortcomings have been in terms of touchdowns (two through four games after tallying 18 through 15 games last year).

He did subsequently atone with eight- and 11-yard touchdown runs in the third quarter, giving him back-to-back two-score efforts. However, Gurley's usage, seemingly due to a combination of workload management and game script, continues to be limited; he's yet to exceed 16 carries or 19 total touches from scrimmage in any contest this season. Naturally, fantasy managers who invested significant draft capital in Gurley are disappointed to an extent, and his outlook doesn't figure to be much brighter in a Week 6 divisional battle versus a tough 49ers front seven a week from Sunday."

Carson looks like the bell cow, and any worries of Rashaad Penny cutting into Carson's workload can be safely brushed aside for now, as Penny was simply a change-of-pace back with six carries for 18 yards."

With Justin Jackson (calf) trending toward missing another game, all three backs should suit up versus Denver, but expect Gordon to at least jump Pope on the depth chart now that he's had more time to get acclimated again. It's worth noting that Lynn said that Gordon's workload Sunday wouldn't be \"too big\" and added that he \"can't give him 50 snaps,\" seemingly implying the 26-year-old won't definitively supplant Ekeler as the team's top option, at least for this week."

        "analysis": "Howard's stellar stat line encapsulates how critical he was to the upset road win, with the fourth-year back seeing his largest workload of the season and capitalizing in fine fashion. Howard's pair of rushing scores came in his usual red-zone/goal-line role, as he went in from one and two yards out in the second and fourth quarter, respectively. He sandwiched those visits to the end zone around a 20-yard scoring grab early in the third quarter to cap off a 76-yard drive that erased a slim 21-20 deficit. Howard has now seen his carries increase over that of the prior game in each contest, while his receptions, receiving yards and targets Thursday were all season highs. While the Eagles' backfield situation is far from ideal due to the timeshare between Howard and Miles Sanders, the former looks like a viable play in all formats for a Week 5 interconference battle versus the Jets a week from Sunday."

The more dynamic Jones appears to be progressively pulling away with the lead-back job, although it will take multiple weeks with the USC product helming the ground attack for fantasy managers to have complete confidence in that arrangement.

        "analysis": "White led the team in targets, catches and yards, as Tom Brady found himself checking down often with Buffalo's secondary blanketing New England's wide receivers. The running back is a strong PPR option thanks to his receiving ability out of the backfield, but White is rarely called upon to do much on the ground. After a collective dud here, the entire Patriots offense should be significantly better in Week 5 against the underwhelming Washington defense."

He was stopped at the 1-yard line twice on the Bills' lone touchdown drive before watching quarterback Josh Allen take it in himself on fourth down. Allen later left the game with a concussion, muddying the waters even further for an offense that's already missing rookie running back Devin Singletary (hamstring). Gore should once again handle heavy volume in what projects to be a low-scoring affair against the Titans in Week 5, especially if SIngletary sits again. It's perhaps worth noting Gore is the oldest player in football to rush for 100-plus in a game since 1978."

Sanders also showed well while moonlighting as the Eagles' sole kick returner, and although backfield mate Jordan Howard stole the headlines with three total touchdowns, Sanders' second consecutive strong effort on the ground after a sluggish first two weeks was highly encouraging for the rookie's fantasy managers. Moreover, although he surprisingly wasn't targeted in the passing game, that seems like a clear outlier after Sanders logged 10 looks over the first three contests.

His value likely depends on the health of Damien Williams, but Williams looks like a quality play if it's only him and Shady McCoy in the backfield."

The backup rusher has now ran for just 58 yards on 14 attempts the past three contests, and his fantasy value is plummeting. While this could prove to be a buy-low spot, there's also reasons to be pessimistic about Brown's value moving forward. Todd Gurley is still the clear-cut No. 1 running back, and 2019 third-round selection Darrell Henderson could become more involved at some point."

Abdullah has the misfortune of playing behind Dalvin Cook and Alexander Mattison. Each is averaging over five-plus yards per carry right now. As Sunday showed, Abdullah can help out a passing game that has struggled mightily this season, but given Cook's abilities as the team's third-leading receiver, Abdullah isn't likely to get too much extra work even if the Vikings try to mix it up a little."

Beckham didn't make a catch until the fourth quarter but showed off his athleticism on a trick play, avoiding a pair of would-be tacklers in the backfield before uncorking a deep ball that went right through the hands of Damion Ratley. It's good to see the Browns trying to find other ways to get the ball in Beckham's hands, but second-year quarterback Baker Mayfield has regressed after a strong finish to his rookie season, leading to a relatively quiet start to the year for the star receiver, outside of his 89-yard touchdown against the Jets in Week 2. Expect Beckham to bounce back on Monday Night Football in San Francisco in Week 5, especially if Landry's unable to suit up."

It doesn't look like Lockett, who also logged four targets in Week 4, will consistently draw the sort of volume he did between Weeks 2 and 3, when he saw a combined 26 looks, but he continues to see plenty of snaps in Seattle's offense, including a 91 percent share Thursday night."

He is back to being a fantasy producer after a down 2018 in which he only logged 69 receptions for 734 yards, as he is currently on pace to account for 92 receptions, 1,200 yards and eight touchdowns if his first-quarter regular-season stats were to be extrapolated out to 16 games. Upcoming in Week 5, he and the Cardinals receiving corps will face a Bengals defense that has allowed a shade under 270 passing yards per game since the start of last season."

        "analysis": "Moore finished with a modest stat line overall, as second-year quarterback Kyle Allen focused heavily on Christian McCaffrey through the air. Moore has seen only seven combined targets over the two games thus far that have featured Allen under center, compared to the 24 looks he logged across the first pair of contests of the season when Cam Newton (foot) was at the controls. The 2018 first-round pick is capable of much more than the four receptions and 96 yards he compiled over Weeks 3 and 4, so he'll look to improve his chemistry with Allen during the practice week ahead of a Week 5 home game against the Jaguars."

        "analysis": "Pettis' groin injury was kept under wraps to begin the season, and this pectoral injury is only now being announced to the public despite it developing during the preseason. This could help explain the second-year wideout's lack of production through three weeks (five receptions on six targets for 27 yards and a touchdown). The good news is that Shanahan stated that Pettis has been regaining both lower- and upper-body strength, and that culminated in the receiver's best stat line against the Steelers in Week 3 (four receptions for 20 yards and a touchdown). The 49ers' upcoming bye week could help the 23-year-old inch even closer to midseason form. While fantasy owners are unlikely to trust Pettis enough to start him following the rough start, it is worth noting that he has been seeing nearly as many offensive snaps over the past two games (68) as rookie Deebo Samuel (70). It appears that the two youngsters are in a starter's timeshare alongside Marquise Goodwin, who leads all San Francisco wide receivers with 90 offensive snaps over that same two-week period."

        "analysis": "Chark was held out of the end zone for the first time this season and was largely unable to break free from the Broncos' secondary for big plays. However, the performance still had encouraging moments as he hauled in a catch in the end zone that was nullified by a holding call and also led the team in targets. In addition, he made a nice diving catch down the sideline to convert a 24-yard catch near the end of the first quarter -- his longest of the game. Chark will look to return to the end zone in Week 5 against the Panthers."

Overall, he has just 17 targets and 10 receptions through four games, but he has quickly proven to be a big-play threat by averaging 22.3 yards per reception. Despite an inconsistent passing attack, Brown shows continuously growing rapport with Marcus Mariota, and that should only increase as the season progresses."

Starting quarterback Josh Allen got knocked out of the game in the fourth quarter with a concussion, but backup Matt Barkley proved capable of moving the offense effectively with 127 passing yards after coming in. While Buffalo's red-zone efficiency will likely suffer without the threat of Allen running the ball, the team's receivers could actually benefit from having a more accurate quarterback under center should Allen need to sit out against the Titans in Week 5 or beyond, though having Allen back clearly gives the offense more long-term upside."

The 25-year-old has had a steady complementary role in the three games he's suited up for, logging 11 targets and parlaying them into eight receptions. The Illinois product is still a firm third in the receiver pecking order behind Davante Adams (toe) and Marquez Valdes-Scantling, but he'll look to play a bigger role in a potential Week 5 shootout against the Cowboys a week from Sunday."

For the time being, however, Robinson can be utilized as a high-upside play in an explosive Chiefs offense."

Tyreek Hill's (shoulder) eventual return also figures to eat away at his fantasy value."

He came alive a little against Jacksonville, particularly on a shot up the sideline in the second quarter in which he gained 28 yards. Those sorts of plays -- even if Hamilton continues to improve -- are unlikely as he does most of his best work underneath, but Sunday showed some improved rapport with quarterback Joe Flacco that will be worth tracking. Next up is a Chargers team that has had an uneven start to the season."

The solid line essentially amounted to a breakout effort for Graham, who'd seen just one target apiece in each of the previous two games and hadn't recorded a reception since the opener versus the Bears.

Waller leads Oakland in catches, targets, and yards, but it's fair to wonder where the touchdowns are for a big-bodied target averaging over eight catches per game. Pay dirt has to be coming eventually, but the Bears will be a tough team to do it against in Week 5."

        "analysis": "Brate crossed the goal line officially for the first time this season, bringing in a 13-yard scoring pass from Jameis Winston on the first play of the fourth quarter. The fifth-year pro had also seen two other touchdowns nullified by penalty back in Week 1 against the 49ers, so he still retains some red-zone equity. However, Brate has yet to see more than three targets in any contest this season, so he'll remain a speculative, touchdown-dependent option versus the Saints in Week 5."

Meanwhile, Everett has logged 19 looks over the same span, turning those into 12 catches, 180 yards and a touchdown.
