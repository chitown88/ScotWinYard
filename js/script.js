    "analysis": "He carried the ball a team-high nine times for 26 yards, but it was one yard too few, as Allen's last-minute 4th-and-1 keeper inside-the-five came up inches short as his feet slipped out from underneath him on the slick grass. The Bills were ultra-aggressive, passing up the short field goal to tie the game at 34-34 and instead tried to go for the win. We like the call, as the Bills were moving the ball at will; it just didn't work. Allen was great on the night as a whole, tossing 14- and 29-yard touchdowns to Stefon Diggs and Cole Beasley in the first half before hitting TE Tommy Sweeney for a one-yarder in the third frame. Allen then caught a two-pointer from TE Dawson Knox on the next play. Allen has been incredible after a down Weeks 1 and 2. He has 14 touchdowns over his last four games and heads into the bye before a Week 8 home date with the lowly Dolphins.\n",

    "analysis": "Murray's first scoreless start of the season was also the Cardinals' first loss. It didn't have to be that way, as the Cards were driving for the game-winning score with 0:15 remaining from the Packers' five-yard line. That is when Murray targeted A.J. Green in the end zone and the veteran wideout just kept blocking. The ball hit off Green, and\u00a0Rasul Douglas hauled it in for a game-ending interception. Already limping after getting his foot tangled up a few moments earlier, Murray then remained down for several moments before walking gingerly to the sideline. Whatever he is dealing with, he has 10 days to get healthy for Week 9 vs. the 49ers. The same is true for DeAndre Hopkins, who was in and out of the game all evening as he battled hamstring tightness. Murray has plateaued in fantasy after a hot start, though he is still providing QB1 returns nearly every week, and will surely bounce back to elite status sooner rather than later.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "The Eagles continue grappling for an offensive identity, starting a dual-threat quarterback for whom the coaching staff won't design unique game plans. Amid Philadelphia's weekly offensive struggles, Wulf said head coach Nick Sirriani \"needs to back [Jalen] Hurts completely until he\u2019s ready to make a move, even if he\u2019s considering it behind the scenes. But if Hurts continues to regress, the Eagles will owe it to themselves to give Minshew a look. The reasons you outlined are true, although I do think there\u2019s value in evaluating Minshew as the Eagles move into the offseason.\" Hurts has gotten by for fantasy purposes thanks to garbage time production -- both through the air and on the ground. His overall numbers leave quite a bit to be desired though. Hurts' 7.1 yards per attempt is 22nd among all QBs; his adjusted completion rate is 29th; and his completion rate while under pressure (31 percent) ranks 31st. Superflex managers should consider adding Minshew sooner rather than later.\u00a0\n",

The story of the day was the Chargers' reversal of fortune on fourth down, where they went 1-for-4. They turned it over on downs from their own 39 and 19-yard line, with the latter failure coming in the third quarter and essentially ending the game. They were already losing 24-6, so it was a sensible gamble. It just didn't work. Herbert has had some accuracy issues creep in of late, but nothing of a systematic variety. Just tough games in a tough league. Mike Williams' knee issue surely did not help this afternoon. Still looking like an MVP contender on the whole, Herbert gets the Chargers' bye before a tough Week 8 date with a Patriots defense that eradicated the Bolts in a 45-0 2020 victory. That game, of course, was with Anthony Lynn instead of Brandon Staley on the sideline.\u00a0\n",

He still stepped up when it mattered most down the stretch, putting the Vikings up 25-17 with a perfectly placed five-yard dime to Adam Thielen (11/126/1) in the third quarter and engineering a nine-play, 75-yard drive in overtime that was capped with a 27-yard walk-off touchdown to K.J. Osborn. On bye next week, Cousins should be considered a high-end QB2 when the Vikings return in Week 8 against Dallas.\n",

His touchdowns were a red-zone throw to TE Mo Alie-Cox and a fade to Michael Pittman from 28 yards out. Wentz avoided throwing an interception for the fifth straight game but was charged with a fumble that was really a desperation pick trying to avoid a sack. Outside of that, this was another step forward for Wentz, who has won three of the last four games. The Colts get a matchup with the division-leading Titans in Week 8.\u00a0\n",

His downfield chemistry with Ja'Marr Chase only gets better with every passing week, as Ravens defenders discovered on Sunday. Burrow overcame a hostile Baltimore crowd and operated the team's offense without a hiccup while using a silent count (until Ravens fans were quieted to a hush in the fourth quarter). After bringing along Burrow slowly in the season's first month, head coach Zac Taylor appears to have removed the restricter plate for Burrow and the Bengals offense. Burrow will be a top fantasy play next week against the Jets.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Winston boosted his stat line with eight rushes for 40 yards with his legs, setting season-highs as a runner with Taysom Hill out with a concussion. He also wasn't helped by his wideouts in the pass game, as Tre'Quan Smith was on a completely different page most of the night while Kevin White and Kenny Stills dropped deep balls. Winston's touchdown pass was a 13-yarder to Alvin Kamara, who caught 10 balls for 128 yards and the score. Winston isn't a fantasy option in this low-volume offense but gets a potential ceiling spot next week against the Bucs.\n",

Jones has just one game with over 300 passing yards or multiple touchdowns through the air but does get a juicy matchup with the Chiefs next week. Normally a high-end QB2, Jones will jump into the back-half of the QB1 ranks versus Kansas City.\u00a0\n",

He nearly took a safety before getting rid of it. Smith was sacked five times in this one and was flat-out pitiful, looking scared in the pocket and missing open receivers all night. His first pass of the evening was an 84-yard touchdown to DK Metcalf where Metcalf manhandled Marshon Lattimore for the ball. Smith did nothing positive. This offense is unwatchable with him under center. We're going to get another dose of Smith next week against the Jaguars before Russell Wilson (finger) is hopefully back following the Week 9 bye.\n",

His scores went for five yards to Calvin Ridley and 49 to Russell Gage, who ran right by Jevon Holland. Ryan did lose a fumble on an ill-fated fourth quarter scramble, though his \"interception\" was actually a catch that Ridley simply let get ripped away. Ridley has remained an issue for Ryan, as he can't get his alpha wideout going. Hopefully that changes in Week 8 against the collapsing Panthers.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

The Dolphins and Panthers are both interested in acquiring Watson, who faces sexual assault allegations from more than 20 women. With the Panthers likely ready to move on from Sam Darnold -- who was benched in Week 7 -- and the Dolphins souring on Tua\u00a0Tagovailoa's lack of development, it could come down to which franchise is willing to take on the ferocious public relations blowback that would come with acquiring Watson. NBC Sports' Peter King reported Monday that Dolphins owner Stephen Ross \"is not pushing his football people to deal for Watson right now.\"\u00a0 Rapoport said Watson is in \"good shape\" and could play immediately upon being traded. The Texans have done the league a favor through seven weeks and made Watson inactive.\u00a0\n",

The Football team gets their bye in Week 9 but a return immediately following that seems optimistic right now. Taylor Heinicke will remain under center for the foreseeable future. Heinicke ranks 23rd in yards per attempt (7.1) and 24th in passer rating (86.8) among qualified passers. Only Terry McLaurin, J.D. McKissic, and Ricky Seals-Jones can be trusted as fantasy options from this team's passing game.\n",

Lawrence, who completed 70% of his passes in Week 5, continued to show improvements, though he had a turnover on a sack-fumble in the second half that let Miami back in the game. Lawrence's touchdown was a perfectly placed back-shoulder fade into tight coverage to Marvin Jones. He didn't have as much of a role in the run game this week, rushing for 11 yards on four carries and picking up a first down. Lawrence has shown signs of a breakout the last three weeks and should continue to see pass heavy game scripts going forward. He gets a matchup with Seattle after Jacksonville's Week 7 bye.\u00a0\n",

Missing Davante Adams and Allen Lazard to the COVID-19 list, Rodgers was in survival mode this evening \u2014 he was averaging 3.0 yards per attempt at halftime \u2014 but conjured just enough play-making magic with Randall Cobb to supplement a potent rushing attack in this narrow road victory. It was Cobb who corralled each of Rodgers' scores in the end zone as a random assortment of rogues and ruffians mixed in for targets behind Aaron Jones' team-leading total of 11. Adams and Lazard now have 10 days to go negative ahead of a colossal inter-conference matchup with the Chiefs in Week 9. Marquez Valdes-Scantling (hamstring) should also be returning.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "On a day where the Lions emptied out their bag of tricks \u2014 they converted two fake punts and recovered a first quarter onside kick \u2014 Goff reminded the Rams why they traded him, throwing what proved to be a game-sealing end zone interception with 4:53 remaining. It killed a marathon Lions drive, one that would have culminated with a Lions lead had they found the end zone. Goff was hit as he threw and let Jalen Ramsey run T.J. Hockenson's route for him. Goff added another pick for good measure with the Lions out of timeouts and trailing 28-19 with 0:32 remaining. Ultimately, it was a decent day for a quarterback without weapons, though D'Andre Swift did all of the work on the duo's 63-yard screen score in the opening frame. The Lions know Goff is not their future, but they lack better options for the present. Seeing as they are 0-7, it doesn't hold water that they would need to bench Goff to tank for better draft position. The Eagles are on deck for Week 8.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "It's quite the declaration after weeks of hedging when asked by reporters if the Dolphins want Tua as their starter amid nonstop speculation that Miami might trade for Deshaun Watson and all his legal baggage. Flores' commitment to Tua for 2021 wouldn't preclude the team from acquiring Watson before the league's November 2 trade deadline and sitting him until the 2022 season. It appears Tua is set, for now, as Miami's starter. He's had a red-hot couple of games since returning from injury, completing 74.8 percent of his passes for 620 yards, six touchdowns, and three picks.\u00a0\n",

Fields has completed 65.6 percent of his passes when using play action, 11 percent higher than his non-play action throws. His yards per attempt jumps from 5.8 without play action to 7.6 with play action. The Bears' offense was as stale as ever in their Week 7 demolition against Tampa, doing nothing in the way of misdirection or creative play calling. Nagy seems content letting Fields drop back like a traditional pocket passer. Hopefully Chicago's next coach will recognize Fields' potential as a dual threat QB.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "The expected quarters and quarters of garbage time never developed as the Lions kept the game surprisingly tight, but Swift made sure that didn't matter by housing a screen for a 63-yard touchdown on the Lions' opening drive. After that, it was a day of what might have been, as Swift got stood up on some critical short-yardage carries in the third quarter before Jared Goff missed him on what probably should have been TD No. 2. Goff's second interception was a too-high pass that hit off Swift's hands. It was still impossible to complain as Swift provided his hoped-for big play and PPR stat padding. The pathetic Eagles are on deck for Week 8, keeping Swift locked in as an RB1.\u00a0\n",

It was a disappointing failure for fantasy managers justifiably anticipating a top-five day, but Henderson has yet another dream spot for Week 8 in the Texans. We doubt he will go 0-for-2 on these golden matchups.\u00a0\n",

Like Mixon, Perine burst through the middle of the Baltimore defensive line for a lengthy touchdown (46 yards) to seal the game for Cincy. His presence once again limited Mixon's pass game involvement -- a potentially major factor for Mixon for the remainder of the season. Perine, who would be the team's RB1 if Mixon were to miss time, should be rostered in 12-team leagues.\n",

Today was also the first time he was held out of the end zone since Week 1, an unfortunate regression to the mean after he piled up six scores over his past four appearances. Looking rejuvenated in a stacked skill corps behind a healed up offensive line, Zeke should continue to provide consistent RB1 returns even as Tony Pollard maintains standalone FLEX value. The Cowboys get a bye before returning against the Vikings in Week 8.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "The Saints have used Kamara as more of a traditional, between-the-tackles runner this season while the team's personnel limitations have stopped coaches from deploying Kamara in a more \"dynamic\" role, Underhill said. Kamara, who handled 20 rushing attempts Monday night against Seattle, already has 61 percent of the carries he had in 2020 and should blow by his career high in rushes this year. Saints coaches wanted to use Kamara more as a pass catcher lining up in the slot and out wide, but \"those plans got blown up when Tony Jones Jr. suffered an injury against the Giants,\" Underhill said, adding that a \"higher percentage of [Kamara's] touches are coming on runs up the middle where he\u2019s getting hit by bigger and stronger players than he would be on a reception or run outside the numbers.\" Ingram absorbing some of those hits on up-the-middle runs should mitigate wear and tear on Kamara and could lead to a more prominent pass-catching role. His PPR prospects don't take a hit with the addition of Ingram. Kamara has a team-high 26 percent target share through Week 7.\u00a0\n",

It remains to be seen how the Browns will replace Kareem Hunt, who is currently on injured reserve with a calf injury. D'Ernest Johnson dominated the Broncos this week with 146 yards on 22 carries but profiles as the backup to Chubb. Demetric Felton earned three receptions and two rush attempts in that game and would fill Hunt's pass-catching role more naturally. Both backs are worth holding onto in deeper leagues but the backfield figures to be Chubb's to lose until Hunt returns.\n",

    "analysis": "Edmonds took a direct snap from the Packers' 11-yard line in the first quarter and finally reached the end zone for his first score of 2021. Naturally, James Conner vultured two more touchdowns on only five touches, but Edmonds once again comfortably bested his veteran backfield mate in yardage. There was a scary moment midway through the second half where Edmonds landed hard on his right side after a reception, but he thankfully shook it off quickly and was back in a few plays later. Conner makes for moments of weekly frustration, but Edmonds is mostly reaching home as a PPR RB2. The 49ers are on deck for Week 9.\u00a0\n",

Harris leads all running backs with an 86% snap share this season, and will remain the unquestioned lead running back. It's possible that Harris could see his snaps dip into the 75-80% range if McFarland can mix in for an occasional series. Even still, McFarland would lack standalone value. The second-year running back should be in deep leagues as a contingent value play.\n",

The Panthers consequently had seven rushing attempts on their opening drive against a soft Giants defense, and lead back Chuba Hubbard finished with 12 rushes for 28 yards (along with four receptions for 28 yards). He blamed himself and other Carolina coaches for \"not coaching Sam [Darnold] well enough,\" insisting the team's struggles aren't \"about Sam,\" who was benched on Sunday. \"We needed more from the run game. We needed some explosive plays,\" Rhule said. \"We needed some guys to make some big catches.\" Rhule discovered, as most head coaches of bad teams do, that establishing the run is difficult when playing from behind, as the Panthers did in Week 7. Hubbard should continue to see solid usage when Carolina can create neutral or positive game script. That might come as soon as Week 8 against the Falcons.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Jones was actually out-carried 16-15 by AJ Dillon as the Pack relied on the running game in Davante Adams' absence, but Jones out-touched Dillon 22-16 and out-gained him 110-78. Much to his fantasy managers' chagrin, Dillon did not receive a goal line carry as Jones got stood up from the Cardinals' one twice inside the 5:00 mark in the fourth quarter. Jones was initially ruled to have scored touchdown No. 2, but it was overturned on review. Dillon is getting more involved of late but still has not meaningfully threatened Jones' No. 1 supremacy, and has yet to really even push for \"1B\" status. The sophomore did look excellent on Thursday evening, however. Regardless of Dillon's level of involvement, Jones will be an elite RB1 for Week 9 vs. the Chiefs' collapsed defense.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Herbert did the impossible and had a solid rushing day against the NFL's toughest run defense. Tampa hadn't given up more than 67 yards to a running back this season before Herbert's Week 7 performance. The rookie saw passing-down work too, even with Damien Williams back from the COVID-19 list. Herbert is clearly the Bears' RB1 for as long as David Montgomery (knee) is sidelined, and should have a weekly role when Montgomery returns to action. Herbert, who has drawn praise from coaches and teammates alike, is the only startable Bears player in Week 8 against the 49ers.\u00a0\n",

Johnson already has been the snap leader in Houston's backfield for the last four weeks -- if he gets up from the mid-50's into the 70s, he'll be viable in a FLEX role.\u00a0\n",

The veteran out-carried Williams 8-4, though Williams got him 6-2 through the air, turning a screen into a 10-yard touchdown with 5:23 remaining. It was an impressive play, but not moreso than Gordon's score one quarter earlier. Williams is providing some big-play juice, but Gordon has hardly been chopped liver. With the passing game struggling to make noise, the Broncos are almost certainly going to keep both backs heavily involved for the foreseeable future. Williams will remain a low-end RB2/FLEX for Week 8 vs. the Football Team.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Conner was not targeted in the passing game. Like clockwork, Chase Edmonds was the more explosive back between the 20s, but it was Conner who emerged with yet another two-score game, his third of the season. Thankfully for Edmonds managers, he did manage to find the end zone for his first touchdown of 2021. Conner's five carries were his fewest since Week 2 and by far his fewest of the year, but it had more to do with game flow than anything else. Leads and sustained drives were scarce for the Cardinals this evening. Executing his job with ruthless efficiency, Conner will remain a scoring-based FLEX for Week 9 against the 49ers' gettable run defense.\u00a0\n",

Hyde has operated as James Robinson's backup for the past two weeks. He is reportedly dealing with a shoulder injury and didn't feel right before the game. Dare Ogunbowale will take on the backup duties for this game. Ogunbowale is a capable pass-catcher and contributes on special teams but doesn't figure to eat into Robinson's rushing role as much as Hyde would have. Hyde's absence solidifies Robinson as a top-20 fantasy back on the week.\n",

That grab briefly went in the books as a 61-yard touchdown after Hopkins put a stunningly filthy in-air double move on Pack CB Eric Stokes, but Nuk was justifiably called for a facemask penalty near the goal line. He then missed nearly two entire quarters of action before surprisingly returning midway through the third quarter. The Cards \"picked their spots\" from there on out \u2014 Hopkins apparently did so a few times without the coaching staff's approval \u2014 and it resulted in one more target as Nuk still spent most of his time on the sideline. Hopkins' Week 9 health cannot be taken for granted once the adrenaline wears off, though he will have 10 days to get healthy for a divisional showdown with the 49ers.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "The five targets were a bitter disappointment, but Sutton's 5/68 was something of a miracle after he entered halftime 1/31. Sutton's amazing one-handed snag in the first quarter was one of just two first half first downs for the Broncos. Teddy Bridgewater thankfully got it going after the break. Nearly every one of Sutton's grabs featured a vivid display of his physical dominance. He is more than back from his 2020 ACL tear, though Jerry Jeudy's (ankle) likely Week 8 return will introduce a major targets variable. Sutton will nevertheless be an upside WR2 vs. Washington's pathetic defense.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Chase tormented Ravens CB Marlon Humphrey time and again as Baltimore refused to double cover the red-hot rookie wideout. His wildly productive day included an 82-yard touchdown during which he spun out of a tackle and outran everyone. If there were any lingering questions about Chase being the team's alpha No. 1 wideout, they were answered against Baltimore's overmatched secondary. Chase might have pushed for 300 yards if the Bengals didn't bench their starters early in the fourth quarter. The Bengals finally getting back to their pass-heavy ways following a run-heavy start to the regular season means Chase has as much upside as any receiver in the game. He'll be a locked-in WR1 in Week 8 against the Jets.\u00a0\n",

One of his missed connections today was a Matt Ryan \"interception\" that was really a catch Ridley let get ripped out of his hands. Another was an over-the-middle look where Ridley essentially got broken in two by the defense. That one was Ryan's fault. Ridley remained down for a few moments before making it to the sideline under his own power and quickly returning. Ridley's quiet day came as Kyle Pitts contributed five receptions of 20-plus yards. Pitts' emergence is going to free up space for Ridley, who can't keep operating at this level of inefficiency. He will be on the WR1/2 borderline for Week 8 against the Panthers.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

Hilton's a potential WR3/FLEX if he plays, and he might take Michael Pittman's ceiling down if he suits up as well.\u00a0\n",

The first was a one-yarder where Lamb got wide open in the end zone. The second was a walk-off, 35-yard score in overtime. Lamb got freed by play-action and blew by Jalen Mills. The entire stadium knew the game was over the second the ball left Dak Prescott's hand. Hurt by an overabundance of run-friendly game scripts, Lamb had been in something of a slump since Week 2. He began to bust it with 4/84/1 in Week 5 before obliterating it today as Prescott attempted 51 passes. The Cowboys now head on bye for Week 7 before returning against a struggling Vikings defense that watched Patrick Peterson get banged up on Sunday. Buckle up.\u00a0\n",

We would assume both wideouts have a legitimate chance to play, but there is a good chance we might not have enough information by the time lineups have to be set Sunday morning. For now, consider both players on the wrong side of questionable with a chance to begin getting on track Friday.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Jefferson opened the game with an egregious fumble, gifting the Panthers a short field inside the red zone for Chuba Hubbard to punch in his first career touchdown. Even so, Jefferson garnered one more target than Adam Thielen (11/126/1) on Sunday, being overthrown wide open downfield for a would-be touchdown from Kirk Cousins in the first half. Jefferson has seen at least seven targets in every game this year and remains a strong WR1 when the Vikings return from their bye in Week 8 against the Cowboys.\n",

Teddy Bridgewater will also reportedly be a full participant in practice ahead of Week 8.\n",

Jamison Crowder could see more looks and Michael Carter should continue to draw dump offs from Mike White, who will start in place of Zach Wilson against the Bengals.

As FanDuel's\u00a0JJ Zachariason points out, Cooper has not had a top-24 day in PPR since Week 1. Injury has played a part in that, but waiting for a big Cooper fantasy effort has turned into the gritty modern reboot of\u00a0Waiting for Godot.\u00a0Hopefully Cooper can get back to 100 percent health during the Cowboys' Week 7 bye, and he comes out swinging against the Vikings' lax defense in Week 8.\u00a0\n",

Sanders has been ultra-consistent the last four weeks with a pair of two-touchdown games in that span while averaging 78.25 yards. Sanders gets the Week 7 bye to rest his 34-year-old legs before a Week 8 date with the lowly Dolphins. Playing virtually every snap in this pass-heavy offense, Sanders is an every-week WR2/3 right now.\n",

It has been Gesicki whom Waddle has been battling with, though DeVante Parker (shoulder, hamstring) might finally be ready to return in Week 8. There was a scary moment early in the game where Waddle got his right foot caught in the natural grass, but thankfully the turf gave. Waddle limped around for a few minutes but ended up no worse for the wear. Waddle's usage has been robust enough to draw a top-36 rank for Week 8 against the Bills regardless of whether Parker actually returns. The Dolphins will undoubtedly be north of 40 pass attempts in that contest.\u00a0\n",

Both the six grabs and 70 yards were Woods' second most of the season, but he once again found himself buried in the box score by Cooper Kupp's 10/156/2 on 13 looks. Woods has drawn more than six targets two times in seven games. The volume just isn't there with the Rams no longer having to dial up \"instant offense\" looks to get Jared Goff going. Matthew Stafford thinks bigger. The Texans are the softest of Week 8 opponents, but Woods will be a low-end WR3 with the number of teams on bye decreasing from six to two.\u00a0\n",

Green seemed to have no clue what he was supposed to be doing in the end zone, and coach Kliff Kingsbury said as much in his post-game press conference. Kirk is certainly providing more bang for his target buck right now. He gets the 49ers' undermanned secondary for Week 9.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "It was an ill-timed dud from Patrick, as Jerry Jeudy (ankle) is expected to be active for the first time since Week 1 when the Broncos host the Washington Football Team in Week 8. Patrick has made some big plays along the sideline for this undermanned offense, but he has been held to three-or-fewer grabs in three of his past four contests. Jeudy is going to cut the heart out of Patrick's low-end WR4 value. If you need to make a bye week/injury business decision, you can probably survive cutting Patrick loose in 12-team leagues.\u00a0\n",

His five-yard touchdown in the third quarter, his first since Week 3, was a pure veteran catch, hauling in and toe-tapping a laser from Kirk Cousins along the sideline while Thielen's coverage man was draped all over him. With a shootout expected for Week 8 against Dallas, Thielen can be started with confidence whenever Minnesota returns from its Week 7 bye.\n",

It's not exactly a positive that Shepard has already had hamstring pulls to both legs with more than half the season to go, but he will be active on Monday against the Chiefs' porous defense as we are unsure of Kadarius Toney (ankle) and Kenny Golladay's (knee) status. Shepard will be a usage-based top-30 option with a good matchup.\u00a0\n",

With Chark sidelined in Week 6, both Marvin Jones and Laviska Shenault saw ten targets, though Jones' yard per target average (10) was about double Shenault's (5.4). Jones, who gobbled up 42 percent of the Jaguars' air yards in Week 6 with Chark out, looks to be the primary beneficiary of the receiver room shakeup. Jones is a low-end WR2 going forward.\u00a0\n",

Matt Rhule has already said that Darnold will be the starting quarterback going forward.

That makes Anderson nothing more than a risky WR4 despite the easy matchup.\n",

    "analysis": "Beckham has been playing through troublesome injuries to both of his shoulders. He left the Browns' Week 7 win over the Broncos before halftime after falling on his already-injured, right shoulder but was able to return for the second half. Beckham's time in Cleveland has been marred by injuries and lackluster production but he's consistently played through issues for a receiver-needy offense this year. Even if he's far removed from his prime, his presence will be required for the Browns to have success through the air. The Browns are down to Case Keenum under center with Baker Mayfield currently nursing a shoulder injury of his own. Keenum leaned on Beckham and Jarvis Landry in his first start, targeting the duo on 14 of his 33 pass attempts. Expect a similar approach from the veteran passer going forward.\n",

And Kalif is the same in that way where you know where he\u2019s going to be, you can trust him, you can rely on him and he\u2019s accountable. And that\u2019s all you can ask for as a quarterback.\u201d Though he's acquitted himself well in the horrific Lions offense over the past month, Raymond is still a ways away from being Cooper Kupp, per sources. Raymond has commanded a 21 percent target share over the Lions' past couple games, putting up decent fantasy numbers in garbage time. Raymond, who leads all Lions receivers in pass routes over the past two games, profiles as a serviceable low-end WR3 this week against the Eagles.\u00a0\n",

It sounds like Brown could be an I.R. candidate. With A.B. out last week, Mike Evans and Chris Godwin combined for 21 targets on 36 Tom Brady passes while Tyler Johnson played 67% of the snaps as the third wideout, seeing two targets. Johnson would be someone worth adding if Brown needs to miss extended time.\n",

    "analysis": "Parker on Thursday was noncommittal about suiting up against Buffalo as he struggles with hamstring and shoulder injuries. A limited practice on Friday would make him likely to play in a game where Miami will be forced to throw a lot against the high-powered and heavily favored Bills. Parker would be a decent high-end WR3 option if he plays a full complement of snaps against Buffalo. He caught five of nine targets for 42 yards when the Dolphins played the Bills in Week 2.\u00a0\n",

No tight end is running more routes on the outside of the formation, and only five tight ends have run a greater percentage of slot routes than Pitts through seven weeks. Pitts has lined up as an in-line tight end on a mere 12 percent of his snaps this year. Against the Dolphins in Week 7, Pitts lined up on the outside on a whopping 42.4 percent of his snaps -- the most, by far, among tight ends on the week. He posted an outrageous 18.6 average depth of target in his demolition of the Miami secondary. Patience has paid off for Pitts drafters who ensured a slow September from their tight end.

Bridgewater absolutely loves to throw to Fant short of the sticks. Despite his lack of spiked weeks, Fant's targets are keeping him squarely in the top-eight mix in this especially awful year for fantasy's lowest-upside position. The Broncos do have a plus Week 8 matchup in the Football Team.\u00a0\n",

That is more than enough for Ertz to get home in fantasy. The problem is the deep, spread-out nature of the Cardinals' passing attack. Ertz now has seven grabs for 108 yards and a score through two games in the desert. Not bad, but the production has come on only eight total targets. It will be hard to remain in the TE1 mix if Ertz is seeing 4-5 weekly looks. San Francisco is the next team up for Week 9.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Gesicki tied Jaylen Waddle for the team lead in targets and receptions but narrowly out-gained him while being the only one of the two to find the end zone. Gesicki is now up to 15/200/1 over his past two contests, and has cleared 85 yards in 3-of-7 appearances. He has drawn at least six targets every game since Week 2, and is averaging eight over his past three starts. He is a top-six TE1 any way you slice it, though DeVante Parker might finally be back from his marathon injury in Week 8. The Dolphins will be visiting the Bills, who have not been permissive up the seam.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "For context, Jimmy Graham's\u00a050 catches in 2020 were the 14th most among all tight ends. Callahan, meanwhile, has a strange fascination with five Bengals pass catchers recording 50 grabs this season. The Athletic's Jay Morrison said Joe Burrow \"established an immediate connection\" with Uzomah in 2020, as the tight end saw five targets in Week 1 and six looks in Week 2 before going down with a season-ending Achilles injury in the first half. Drew Sample started the rest of the season for Cincinnati and ran the 12th most tight end routes on his way to a miserable 4.9 PPR points per game. Uzomah, 28, has been fully cleared and is expected to be a full go for training camp. He should be a popular late-round target in the Bengals' pass-heavy offense.\u00a0\n",

He caught only 47 balls in four years, though that includes 12 in three games as a senior.\u00a0Although he holds Oregon state titles in javelin and the 110-meter hurdles, Bates underwhelmed as a 29th percentile athlete at his pro day and failed to record a single red zone touchdown in four seasons with the Broncos. With just four broken tackles on 47 career catches, how he performs as an in-line blocker in camp will ultimately determine how many games he's actually active for his rookie year. Bates doesn't have the looks of an intriguing Dynasty league prospect.\u00a0\n",

He was inactive in Week 5 against the Dolphins and backup kicker Matthew Wright drilled all three of his field goal tries, including a game-winning kick that temporarily relieved Urban Meyer's suffering. Lambo was once among the league's most accurate kickers, making 71 of his 75 field goal tries (94.6 percent) from 2017 to 2019. Wright shouldn't be considered a reliable fantasy option on a Jacksonville team that generates almost no positive game script. Lambo, meanwhile, has a good shot of landing on another team as a fill-in kicker.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "As Over The Cap pointed out on Twitter, 29-year-old Santos has been cut five times since 2018. To say it's an aggressive move would be putting it mildly. The Bears were simply overjoyed by Santos' competent 2020 after years in the kicker wilderness. Santos converted 93.8 percent of his 2020 field goal tries, boosting his career mark to 83.1. Santos is not called on very often from 50-plus yards, making him an extra unlikely recipient of this kind of contract. There's a chance this deal could quickly become an albatross.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Lutz made the announcement Tuesday morning on Twitter. The veteran was designated to return from a groin injury that had kept him sidelined for the season's first six weeks, but wasn't able to suit up Monday night against the Seahawks. Brian Johnson -- who is, for now, the Saints' kicker -- made both of his field goal tries and an extra point in New Orleans' win over Seattle. The Saints have the fewest field goal attempts of any team (6) through Week 7.\u00a0A top fantasy option for much of the Drew Brees era in New Orleans, Lutz won't kick again until 2022.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Fantasy football's No. 2 kicker in 2020 is cashing in on a profoundly efficient season in which he made 36 of 39 field goal attempts, banging through all 36 of his extra point tries. He established himself as one of the league's big-footed kickers by nailing eight of nine kickers over 50 yards. Sanders' extension includes a $10 million guarantee. His 2020 numbers stand in stark contrast to his 2019 stats, which include seven missed field goals on 30 attempts. Only the Cowboys and Falcons attempted more field goals than Miami in 2020, giving Sanders the opportunity necessary to become a waiver wire darling in fantasy. Sanders will probably be one of the most over-drafted kickers in fantasy football next season.\u00a0\n",

No defense is giving up more yards per play (6.7) than them this year and teams are averaging 29.3 points per week when facing Kansas City. Jones' return will give their pass-rush some extra firepower but the Chiefs still project to give up plenty of points to Tennesee.\u00a0\n",

The Dolphins have McCourty listed as a defensive back but have primarily been using him as a safety this year. McCourty opened the year as nearly an every-down player but has seen his snaps cut back in recent weeks. He has been credited with two pass defenses and 21 combined tackles this season.\n",
