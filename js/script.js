Hopkins was his target on a pivotal 4th-and-1 while facing a 28-16 deficit early in the fourth, but the pass didn't connect. Things got even worse for Watson when he was picked off on the next drive, but he bounced back by hitting Hopkins for a four-yard touchdown before throwing another interception to seal the loss in the final minute. Watson has had an up-and-down season under center, with 11 passing touchdowns in his three best outings and just two in his other four games. Despite the inconsistency, Watson remains a strong fantasy play for his team's Week 8 meeting with the Raiders.",

The veteran quarterback then brought the Miami sidelines to life by capping off an 11-play, 60-yard fourth-quarter drive with a gutsy 11-yard scoring scramble that he finished by lowering his shoulder to get into the end zone. Fitzpatrick was reinstated as the starter mid-week after coach Brian Flores backtracked from an earlier statement that Josh Rosen would keep the top job, and given Fitzpatrick's performance Sunday, he's certainly poised to helm the passing attack again in a Week 8 Monday night matchup versus the Steelers.",

He made amends for that error by finding T.Y. Hilton for a two-yard touchdown before halftime, and Brissett continued to spread the ball out in the third quarter with a four-yard touchdown pass to Eric Ebron followed by a three-yarder to Pascal. Brissett has thrown multiple touchdowns in five of six games this season, with a 14:3 touchdown to interception ratio overall. His Colts will play host to the Broncos in Week 8.",

Later, in the fourth quarter, Carr killed a drive by underthrowing a shot to the end zone while facing double coverage, leading to an interception.

Despite Jones' struggles, the Giants have little to gain by turning the starting gig back over to 38-year-old Eli Manning, who has no place in the team's future plans and probably wouldn't offer an upgrade from the rookie in any area other than turnover prevention.

McCaffrey now has seven total touchdowns over the last four games alone and will rest up over the coming bye week ahead of a challenging matchup against the 49ers defense Week 8.",

His impressive day was topped off when the Browns took over on the Seahawks' 24-yard line after an errant punt. Chubb received the ball on two straight plays, rushing twice for 28 yards and a score. That gave the Browns the lead in the fourth quarter, but the Seahawks scored again and ended up with the win. Chubb's effectiveness remains impressive, as this was the third time in four games he recorded at least 100 scrimmage yards, and the one game he failed to do so, he finished with 99 yards.",

Freeman's remorse for the incident in addition to the fact that he doesn't have a prior track record of flagrant on-field conduct likely means he won't be subjected to any further punishment from the NFL other than perhaps a small fine.",

In addition to the poor efficiency, Gordon also lost a fumble at the goal line with 19 seconds remaining in the game to secure defeat for the Chargers. While he has clearly been the team's top back over Austin Ekeler since returning in Week 5 against Denver, Gordon has averaged just 2.25 yards per carry. Given his critical error in Week 7 and his inability to hit long runs, it wouldn't be particularly surprising to see the Chargers give Ekeler a few extra looks Week 8 against the Bears.",

McKissic, and we think those guys are ready to step into roles.\"",
        "analysis": "Coming into Week 8, Ty Johnson was already a popular waiver-wire target with the expectation that Kerryon would be sidelined for multiple games. With Kerryon now requiring surgery that will keep him sidelined through mid-December, Ty should get the first crack at leading the Lions' ground game, though Patricia suggested that McKissic and new acquisition Tra Carson could mix in as well. After Kerryon exited early in the 42-30 loss to the Vikings last weekend, Ty played 64 percent of Detroit's offensive snaps the rest of the way, finishing the afternoon with 57 total yards on 14 touches (10 carries, four receptions). Meanwhile, McKissic racked up 60 yards on seven touches (five carries, two receptions), but only played 25 percent of the snaps.",

The veteran passer adjusted quickly, flipping the ball out into the flat for a two-yard touchdown to Williams. Though he scored, the performance was a letdown after Williams' 136-yard game in Week 6. The BYU product has been more efficient on the season than stablemate Aaron Jones, averaging 4.6 yards per carry to Jones' 4.0, but has garnered more touches than Jones just twice in six games. It'd be foolish to count on him to get the lion's share of carries in any given week, though he's become a relatively reliable receiver with three receiving touchdowns this season.",

That never surfaced, as Chris Carson piled up 21 carries and three catches while C.J. Prosise garnered one rush for 17 yards. Carson wasn't efficient with just 3.1 YPC, but the Seahawks' offensive line provided no help. Still, if Carson isn't ripping off big gains, Penny should have a role, albeit a limited one, in the backfield rotation when he's fully healthy. He'll look to get into the fold Week 8 against the Falcons.",

Anderson, who ranks second on the Jets with 266 receiving yards this season, would have appeal to playoff-contending teams looking for a deep-ball threat on the outside.",

The loose ball was recovered by Buffalo's Jerry Hughes and returned to the Dolphins' 11-yard line, and Cole Beasley crossed the goal line three plays later on a three-yard scoring grab.

Parker will look to put together another strong performance at the expense of the Steelers in a Week 8 Monday night matchup.",

With nine catches for 140 yards in five games to date, Washington has been off the fantasy radar in most formats, but he's at least looking a favorable matchup in Week 8.",

However, that volume has resulted in just nine receptions, 101 yards and no scores. Allison is getting his opportunities right now, but with Adams due back at some point, and fellow wideouts Jake Kumerow and Allen Lazard pushing for more snaps, he could eventually see fewer chances if his output does not increase.",

Though Sanu earned six targets per game through the Falcons' first seven games, Gage won't necessarily be in store for that sort of volume. Instead, expect the Falcons to spread Sanu's vacated targets among a number of pass catchers that includes Gage, whose fantasy stock will get a bump.",

The Rams head into a Week 8 matchup against the Bengals, who did not allow a completion to a Jacksonville tight end Sunday but gave up six catches for 99 yards to Baltimore's Mark Andrews the previous outing.",

        "analysis": "Even with starter Tyler Kroft back from an ankle injury, Knox still saw a season-high five targets, though his final output was lacking. The rookie played a modest 52 percent of the offensive snaps, however,  which was a season low, while Kroft saw 45 percent and blocker Lee Smith saw 41 percent. While Knox has long-term upside, his 2019 outlook remains muted if he has to share time in an offense that leans toward the run (10th in run percentage this season and fifth in 2018).",

That's an issue Fant hopes to bounce back from this weekend, but until he gets back on track after three straight quiet games, he'll remain a speculative fantasy lineup option.",

Walker told John Glennon of The Athletic on Friday that he's dealing with an injury to the same ankle that was dislocated last season, so the veteran could be a week-to-week consideration for the foreseeable future. Such a scenario opens up Walker's 4.4 targets per game for the likes of Smith, MyCole Pruitt and Anthony Firkser in an offense that looks somewhat better with Ryan Tannehill and not Marcus Mariota under center.",

Zach Ertz remains the top tight end in this passing attack, but coach Doug Pederson may be trending toward more formations with two tight ends to aid a wide receiving corps that has taken a beating this season.

Clay (46 percent of the snaps on offense Sunday) and Williams (49 percent) will continue to split work at the position, making them difficult to trust for production from week to week.",

If he remains on the team in 2019 -- he's signed through next season -- Pruitt is unlikely to see any type of consistent role in the offense given that both Delanie Walker and Jonnu Smith are good bets to return to health and retake their roles atop the tight end depth chart.",
