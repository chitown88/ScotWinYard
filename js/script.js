Murray's passing scores were a 41-yard strike to A.J. Green where AJG just beat the defense down the field and a 14-yarder to emerging TE2 consideration Maxx Williams. Murray has played at an MVP level as the Cards have raced to a 4-0 record despite some sloppy mistakes. They are dangerous enough on offense right now to overcome penalties and time management miscues. The reeling 49ers are a wild card Week 5 matchup.\u00a0 \u00a0\n",

That saved face on the fake gridiron, but this was Stafford's first face plant as a Los Angeles transplant. He was sailing throws and escaped with just the one turnover thanks to a roughing the passer penalty that negated a second pick. Stafford did appear to notch a fourth quarter rushing touchdown but was ruled down and the Rams declined to challenge. It was a frustrating day, but we are still more inclined to believe in Weeks 1-3 Los Angeles instead of this week's group. That will be especially true for Thursday's plus matchup in the Seahawks.\u00a0\n",

The Cowboys moved the ball at will without CeeDee Lamb (2/13) making a significant impact, calling manufactured plays for Dalton Schultz (5/50/1) while getting 204 combined rushing yards from Ezekiel Elliott (19/142/1) and Tony Pollard (9/62). Amari Cooper also beat C.J. Henderson one-on-one for a 35-yard touchdown following a perfectly placed ball dime Prescott in the third. The only downside to Dallas' passing offense at this time is the fact Prescott hasn't been asked or needed to throw more than 27 attempts in three consecutive games. Even so, he'll stay a top-five option in next week's soft matchup against the Giants.\n",

    "analysis": "The 400-yard game was the first of third-year pro Jones' career, and came despite Sterling Shepard and Darius Slayton sitting on the shelf with hamstring issues. Jones was buoyed by big-time YAC efforts from Saquon Barkley, Kadarius Toney and Kenny Golladay, who each drew at least six targets. Jones' \"interception\" was a first half Hail Mary. Jones was making big-time throws and giving his wideouts space to make plays. He has unquestionably appeared better this season while cutting down on his turnovers. A potential Week 5 shootout with the Cowboys looms as a massive test.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Sunday marked the second time in Jackson's regular season career he's eclipsed 300 passing yards, and it could've been much more if not for a holding penalty that negated a 30-yard Mark Andrews touchdown grab. Between that called-back score and Marquise Brown's three dropped touchdowns in Week 4, Jackson's passing numbers should look far better than they do through the season's first month. Jackson played conservatively for much of the game against a vicious Denver defense that pressured L-Jax on nearly every drop back. The safe play paid off against a Broncos team that stood no chance of scoring after Teddy Bridgewater exited the contest with a brain injury. The Ravens get four home games in a row starting in Week 5 against the Colts. Jackson will again be an elite QB1 option.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Carr was in the MVP conversation headed into this one, but this game pretty much put an end to that talk. He was 7-of-13 for 52 scoreless yards at halftime with the Raiders trailing 21-0. Carr tried to guide the Raiders back with third-quarter touchdowns to Hunter Renfrow and Darren Waller, but a costly fourth-quarter interception put an end to Vegas' hopes. The throw went to a completely covered Waller and was picked off by Derwin James. Carr has two touchdowns in every game to this point and gets another tougher draw in Week 5 against the Bears on a short week. Carr will be more of a middling QB2 in that one for fantasy.\n",

    "analysis": "Wilson showed off his incredible finesse on multiple plays despite Pete Carroll's resistance to letting him cook. His first magic trick came on a rushing touchdown where he showed his speed and beat Javon Kinlaw to the pylon. On the next drive, Wilson evaded multiple defenders while escaping the pocket and hit Freddie Swain for a 13-yard score. The only thing holding Wilson back is his coaching, but we've known this for years. The Seahawks ran the ball more often than they threw it this week and have been playing incredibly slow all year. Even on limited volume, Wilson is efficient enough to post QB1 numbers on a weekly basis. His matchup with the Rams next week should feature plenty of scoring, giving him a sky-high ceiling for Week 5.\u00a0\n",

Herbert's touchdowns all came in the red zone with four-, 10-, and 14-yard hookups to Donald Parham, Jared Cook, and Austin Ekeler. One throw Herbert would've liked to have back was a would-be 82-yard touchdown to Mike Williams that Herbert badly overthrew when CB Damon Arnette was absolutely roasted off the line. With the Chargers up just 21-14 in the fourth quarter, Herbert completed a 4th-and-2 throw to Jared Cook to keep the drive going and get Ekeler into the end zone again later to give the Chargers a lead they wouldn't relinquish after the momentum was tilting in the Raiders' favor. Herbert has a perfect 7:0 TD:INT mark in wins over the Chiefs and Raiders the last two weeks. The 3-1 Chargers host the Browns in Week 5.\n",

    "analysis": "Brady was outshined by rookie Mac Jones in a touchdownless return to Foxboro. The Bucs were lucky to come away with the win, with the Patriots missing a game-winning field goal. Brady struggled in the red-zone without Rob Gronkowski, and he missed on back-to-back deep shots to Antonio Brown late in the game. After throwing nine touchdowns the first two games, Brady has just one touchdown over the past two weeks. Brady, who passed Drew Brees as the all-time leader in passing yards, will look to get on track in a matchup with the Dolphins in Week 5.\n",

Uzomah for yet another big play. With Tee Higgins (shoulder) on the shelf for his second and apparently final game, Burrow predictably peppered Tyler Boyd and Ja'Marr Chase with targets. Boyd did work after the catch with Chase making tough grabs in traffic. Uzomah was the X factor, however, getting free over the middle of the field and rolling toward the end zone like a bowling ball en route to 5/95/2. Burrow set season highs across the board this evening, with the 300-yard effort being his first of 2021. He averaged an eye-popping 10.9 yards on his 32 attempts, thanks in part to his pass catchers' YAC work. Burrow has been passing the eye test even as the Bengals work to limit his volume coming off his ACL tear. He's going to have to air it out in next week's home showdown with the Packers.\u00a0\n",

The Eagles didn't even attempt to establish a run game for the second straight week, with\u00a0Miles Sanders and Kenneth Gainwell combining for 10 carries.\u00a0Hurts played turnover-free, but he took three sacks, and struggled to move the offense in the second half, with his second touchdown not coming until the final play of the fourth quarter.\u00a0Hurts has averaged 357 yards per game with four touchdowns over the last two weeks. The Panthers' top-ranked secondary is a shy-away matchup in Week 5.\n",

The 23 attempts were actually a season high for Winston, which tells you all you need to know about how he is being used roughly a quarter into the season. Winston is averaging 22 attempts, which isn't close to enough for QB1 returns unless you have Russell Wilson-level efficiency. Winston, of course, has neither Wilson-ian efficiency nor weapons, so this is going to be the toughest of scenes, at least until Michael Thomas returns and re-centers the Saints' talent-barren receiver corps. The Saints travel to Washington for Week 5.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

McKissic, who broke a tackle and scored the go-ahead touchdown for Washington. Against a better secondary,\u00a0Heinicke could have thrown at least a couple interceptions on ill-advised throws into double and triple coverage. His aggressiveness and willingness to give McLaurin chances on downfield shots should make McLaurin an elite fantasy option for the remainder of the season.\u00a0Heinicke will be a decent QB2 option in Week 5 against New Orleans.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Wentz got the job done but it wasn't always pretty. He took a pair of sacks in the first half and looked shaken up at one point but the Colts' three-score lead in the second half made his job fairly easy. Both of his scores wound up in the hands of Mo Allie-Cox. Wentz avoided the big mistakes that plagued him last year but still looks limited by his ankle issues and failed to make any big-time throws versus Miami. He'll get a massive test in Week 5 as he and the Colts will travel to Baltimore to face the Ravens. In a difficult matchup, Wentz can only be trusted as a low-end QB2 next week.\n",

Rodgers added a third score on the ground with a four-yard scamper in the second quarter. Both of Rodgers' passing scores went to Randall Cobb from 23 and one yard(s) out. Rodgers is a borderline QB1/2 most weeks in fantasy; he doesn't have high-number passing days and barely uses his legs anymore. Rodgers gets a road date with the Bengals in Week 5.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Both of Brissett's touchdowns came in the fourth quarter after the Colts had already taken a three-score lead. The veteran passer finally began to take downfield shots but it was too little too late as the game had been out of reach for some time by that point. Brissett added a trio of carries for eight yards on the ground. Through a little less than three games of action, Brissett is averaging just 4.9 yards per pass attempt and is getting sacked three times per game. He gets a potentially exciting matchup with the Bucs next week but it's impossible to find a sense of optimism after watching his poor play in relief of Tua Tagoaviloa. He's a weak option at quarterback even in Superflex leagues.\n",

If he's unable to practice through Friday, he has almost no chance to playing in Week 5. Drew Lock would start for Denver.

He even took a handful of downfield shots, a sorely missing element of Atlanta's offense through the season's opening three weeks. Ryan could continue to get by on pure volume next week against a soft Jets secondary. He'll be a sneaky borderline WR1 option in Week 5.\u00a0\n",

    "headlineNews": "Baker Mayfield had an adjusted completion rate of 58.6 percent in Week 4 against the Vikings, according to Pro Football Focus.\u00a0\n",
    "report": "",
    "analysis": "It's the lowest adjusted completion rate -- the percentage of aimed passes thrown on target -- among any Week 4 starter. Mayfield time and again overthrew his pass catchers against Minnesota, totaling a pathetic 155 yards and no touchdowns against a middling Vikings secondary. Mayfield -- and, consequently, Odell Beckham -- were massive fantasy disappointments in Week 4. Mayfield through four games has the league's seventh lowest adjusted completion rate, just a smidge above Zach Wilson. Mayfield's inability to deliver catchable balls could be a major weekly issue for OBJ.\u00a0\n",

He carried the ball just six times for 17 yards in the first half and then limped off and barely played in the final 30 minutes before three fourth-quarter carries. The Vikings never announced anything, but it looked like Cook aggravated his previous injury. Alexander Mattison ended up out-carrying Cook 10-9. Cook added two catches for 10 yards to his stat line. He gets a real juicy Week 5 date with the Lions, but Cook\u2019s ankle is a big concern.\n",

    "analysis": "Edmonds took advantage of closeout mode to post the second most rushing yards of his career and third most yards from scrimmage. The biggest play was Edmonds' 54-yard scamper on a 3rd-and-7 from the Cardinals' own four-yard line with 10:35 remaining. Edmonds continued to look like the Cardinals' most dangerous back, but James Conner remained the preferred option in the red zone, cashing in a pair of one-yard carries for touchdowns. Conner has enough playmaking ability to provide weekly RB2 returns on 12-15 touches, but his ceiling will be capped as long as Conner gets to keep extending the ball beyond the plane. The Cardinals are hosting the 49ers for Week 5.\u00a0\n",

Elliott also out-touched Tony Pollard 20-10 and saw the Cowboys' lone backfield target. A workhorse in one of the league's most potent and explosive offenses, Elliott will again be ranked as a top-five option against the Giants in Week 4.\n",

    "analysis": "It goes down as Chubb\u2019s first 100-yard rushing game of the season, but he\u2019s now failed to score in back-to-back games. He caught just one pass for five yards and has just four catches on the season. When Chubb isn\u2019t finding the end zone, his stat lines leave a lot to be desired in fantasy with his empty pass-game role. Chubb was stuffed at the goal line in the first half before Kareem Hunt (14-69-1) converted from one yard out a few plays later for the Browns\u2019 lone touchdown. Chubb will be a TD-dependent RB1 next week at the Chargers.\n",

Swift managed four receptions for 33 yards against Chicago. Woodyard said Detroit coaches understand \"what they have in the backfield with two dual-threat runners, so they will ride the hot hand -- meaning that Williams could very well get more touches in any given game if he's rolling, even though Swift is considered to be the RB1.\" Swift remains the superior PPR option in Week 5 against the Vikings, but his takeover of the Lions backfield will apparently have to wait.\u00a0\n",

He was doing yeoman's work, tacking on Capital T Tough yardage after first contact. That includes near the goal line, where he scored a six-yarder after a textbook plant-and-cut. He followed up with a four-yarder where he pile drove to the plane. Robinson was one of the main reasons the Jags almost snapped their 18-game losing streak. Regardless of Hyde's health, Robinson has taken back complete control of the Jags' backfield after coach Urban Meyer tried every other option first. He will be a locked-in RB2 for Week 5 vs. the Titans.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Ekeler sent fantasy players into a panic when he left the field early in the first quarter with a noticeable limp that sent him to the blue medical tent, but he quickly returned and posted his first 100-yard rushing game of the year, matching a season-high with 15 carries. Ekeler's first touchdown was a 14-yard catch where he straight whooped LB K.J. Wright in coverage, and his second was an 11-yard run in the fourth quarter to put L.A. ahead 28-14. Ekeler has four touchdowns in four games to start the year and is an every-week RB1 ahead of a Week 5 date with the Browns.\n",

He's averaging 13.75 carries per game for 46.25 yards on the ground each week, but Harris did punch in his first rushing touchdown with a one-yarder in the fourth quarter in this one.

Rodney Smith's usage in the receiving game came out of left field, though, out-targeting Hubbard 5-2 in what was essentially a blowout game script for the entire fourth quarter; having registered four of his five targets while the Panthers were trailing by two scores, it's possible Smith was only in the game for that reason. It didn't help that Hubbard was also vultured by his own quarterback inside the red zone, seeing Sam Darnold plow ahead for 11- and one-yard rushing scores. Hubbard will still rank as a touch-based RB2 against Philadelphia in Week 5 given the injury-riddled landscape of his position.\n",

An Adam Schefter report from earlier in the day said that Mixon was considered \"week-to-week\", but Taylor seems to be more optimistic. He was also optimistic when he called Mixon week-to-week last year, only for the back to miss the final ten games of the year in 2020. Still, it's an encouraging sign that Mixon's ankle sprain won't sideline him for long. Samaje Perine has served as his backup through four weeks and would be in line for RB2 volume if Mixon can't suit up in Week 5. The Bengals face an injury-weakened Green Bay defense which should help Perine convert on his potential volume. He's a must-add in all fantasy leagues.\u00a0\n",

The first was a 54-yard reception where some play-calling deception got Barkley free down the left sideline. He then looked a wide receiver with his speed making the house call. Barkley's second score was a walk-off, six-yard rush in overtime. He took a read option and got real skinny through the hole, making an excellent cut. There were a few times where Barkley seemed like he was trying to do too much \u2014 including spinning into a fumble the Giants thankfully recovered \u2014 but he continued his trend of looking more explosive each week. The Giants' awful line is going to lead to some volatility, but Barkley is already deserving of being a weekly fixture in the RB1 ranks, including Week 5 against Dallas.\u00a0\n",

Marlon Mack earned a surprising 10 carries after being shopped on the trade market all week. Despite his boost in volume, Taylor backers shouldn't be concerned.

    "analysis": "Baltimore coaches had apparently seen enough of Week 1 starter Ty'Son Williams, deactivating him and treating Murray as something of a workhorse against Denver. There was nothing flashy for Murray, who banged and bashed and plodded his way to 59 yards, much of it after Baltimore had seized a comfortable lead. He saw no pass game involvement against the Broncos. Le'Veon Bell -- made active for the first time this season -- handled just four carries. Murray appears to be the back to roster going forward. He'll be an interesting RB2/3 play next week against the Colts.\u00a0\n",

He could return for Week 9 against Pittsburgh, though the team might rest him through their Week 10 bye and save him for Week 11 against Baltimore. Montgomery is coming off his best game of the season -- a 106-yards, two-touchdown outing against Detroit. His absence opens a rushing vacuum, as Montgomery accounted for 63 percent of the team's rushing attempts, the fifth highest rate in the NFL. Damien Williams will likely serve as the team's primary back over the next month; his pass-catching prowess could translate to a three-down role.\u00a0Khalil Herbert will be sprinkled in and should be rostered in deeper formats in case Williams gets dinged up. Williams should be a solid FLEX, at worst, with Montgomery sidelined.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Hunt was out-carried 21-14 by Nick Chubb, who rushed for an even 100 yards, but it was Hunt who pounded in the Brown' lone touchdown with a one-yard score in the first half after Chubb was stuffed at the goal line earlier in the possession. Hunt has now rushed for touchdowns in back-to-back games while Chubb has been held out of the end zone in two straight contests after scoring Weeks 1 and 2. This backfield remains a tandem with Chubb a TD-dependent RB1 and Hunt the preferred pass-game back and change-of-pace who also gets series to himself. He's a more volatile RB2 ahead of a Week 5 date with the Chargers.\n",

Weird game to read into. It's worth noting that Zack Moss was the first back on the field and that he had five red zone carries to Singletary's one. Singletary remains a RB3/FLEX play at best until his platoon with Moss resolves one way or another.\u00a0\n",

Pollard was still out-carried 20-10 on Sunday and failed to see a single target behind Elliott in the passing game. Still averaging 11 touches through four games, Pollard's outlook as a standalone RB3/4 remains the same. He can be fired up again as such in Week 5 against the Giants.\n",

Sanders has seen more than 60 percent of the Eagles' offensive snaps in each of their first four games, positioning him as the lead back for now. Both Philly RBs will be tough to trust in Week 5 against Carolina.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "It's not what Swift drafters wanted to hear a week after Detroit head coach Dan Campbell said \"you're going to see a lot more\" of Swift in the team's backfield. The exact opposite came to pass in Week 4 against the Bears: Swift saw just eight carries to 14 for Williams, who started the game and rushed for a team-high 66 yards. Swift managed four receptions for 33 yards against Chicago. Woodyard said Detroit coaches understand \"what they have in the backfield with two dual-threat runners, so they will ride the hot hand -- meaning that Williams could very well get more touches in any given game if he's rolling, even though Swift is considered to be the RB1.\" Swift remains the superior PPR option in Week 5 against the Vikings, but his takeover of the Lions backfield will apparently have to wait.\u00a0\n",

Duggar said Collins will continue spelling Chris Carson when Carson needs a breather, dismissing talk of a looming timeshare in the Seattle backfield. \"Could Seattle game plan for an even distribution of snaps between Collins and Carson? Sure. Is Seattle likely to do that? No,\" he said. \"Collins, even when he\u2019s playing well, is effectively in the same tough spot Rashaad Penny was slated to be in: He\u2019s being asked to excel in clean-up duty, a tough position for running backs to execute consistently. The good news for Seattle is Collins appears far more equipped to make the most out of minimal opportunities than Penny.\" Fantasy managers looking to take advantage of backfield injuries should roster Collins this week.\u00a0\n",

Ceding work to Brown has been the norm for Gaskin this year but he also failed to see a target after seeing 16 looks in the passing game in his first three outings of the year. Brown and Ahmed combined for three targets. Miami couldn't mount much of an offense but Gaskins' role is the bigger concern. If he isn't involved as a receiver going forward, he'll be dusted for fantasy purposes. He's an easy stay-away in a grueling matchup with the Bucs next week.\u00a0\n",

Sanders has seen more than 60 percent of the Eagles' offensive snaps in each of their first four games, positioning him as the lead back for now. Both Philly RBs will be tough to trust in Week 5 against Carolina.\u00a0\n",

Dare Ogunbowale will take on the backup duties for this game. Ogunbowale is a capable pass-catcher and contributes on special teams but doesn't figure to eat into Robinson's rushing role as much as Hyde would have.

He failed to notch another touch as the Rams spent the remainder of the game in comeback mode. Not even Rams coach Sean McVay trusts Henderson to stay healthy, but he is clearly comfortable with risking nicks and bruises and keeping Henderson locked in as the clear-cut RB1 for however long he can stay on the field. Michel will be off the Week 5 FLEX radar against the Seahawks on Thursday Night Football.\u00a0\n",

The Patriots have continued punishing rookie\u00a0Rhamondre Stevenson, keeping him inactive since his Week 1 fumble.

Denver had to abandon the run early in the second half after Baltimore got out to a three-score lead, limiting Gordon's usage the rest of the way. There's no reason to think the Broncos' backfield won't be a 50-50 split in Week 5 against the Steelers. Gordon will be a low-end RB2 option if Teddy Bridgewater (concussion) can suit up.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Kupp finally had a quieter game as the Rams' offense tanked, but his 13 targets were actually a season high. Kupp was the victim of a few inaccurate Matthew Stafford passes, which has not been a theme this season. Kupp's usage remains absolutely through the roof as Robert Woods remains a surprising afterthought. Fantasy managers should be more than comfortable going back to the top-five WR1 well for a plus short-week matchup in the Seahawks on Thursday Night Football.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Although Kadarius Toney led the Giants in targets, Golladay paced the Sterling Shepard, Darius Slayton-less receiver corps in production. 28 of Golladay's yards came on a huge grab near the end of regulation where he broke a tackle to tack on major yardage to get the G-Men in field goal range. Golladay was called for a first half OPI penalty, but it was by far his best effort as a Giant. The question is if he will see enough looks for WR2 value once Shepard is back from his hamstring issue. We wouldn't count on it, especially with Toney emerging. The first-round pick was a point of emphasis for Daniel Jones and play-caller Jason Garrett this afternoon. Golladay will be in the WR28-34 range for Week 5 vs. Dallas. He could see a heavy dose of breakout second-year pro Trevon Diggs.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

Samuel has emerged as the clear top pass-catcher in San Francisco, even surpassing George Kittle in the pecking order. He has led the 49ers in targets every week this year and now has at least 90 receiving yards in three of four games. His quarterback for Week 4 is up in the air as Jimm Garoppolo missed the second half with a calf injury but it looks like nothing will be stopping Samuel anytime soon.

It would be a whole lot more fun if Carr would take more of those deep shots to Ruggs during games instead of just one or two. Ruggs also drew a long DPI call earlier in the night to set up an eventual Darren Waller touchdown. Ruggs has seen target counts of 5, 7, 7, and 6 to start his sophomore year. It's progress, but he remains more of a boom-or-bust fantasy WR4.\n",

He was also stopped at the one-yard line on a target inside the 10 during Carolina's second possession, setting up the first of Sam Darnold's two rushing scores on the day. With double-digit targets in three consecutive games, Moore's volume is in no danger of disappearing any time soon \u2014 especially with Christian McCaffrey (hamstring) sidelined for the next 2-3 games. Moore will again rank as a low-end WR1 in Week 5 against the Eagles.\n",

He was listed as a limited participant in practice at the end of last week and showed no signs of the injury versus the 49ers, scoring a touchdown on eight targets. Monday practice reports are also nothing more than estimations by the team's playing on Thursday. The most notable aspect of Seattle's first injury report is Tyler Lockett's absence. Lockett was in and out of practice last week due to a hip issue but is no longer listed. That bodes well for a rebound from the speedster in a projected shootout with the Rams. D'Wayne Eskridge is still dealing with a concussion and could miss Week 5.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "The Eagles fed Smith targets early, with five of his catches and 84 of his yards coming in the first half. Smith was the focal point of the offense as the Eagles ran it just 11 times. This was Smith's best game since his 6/71/1 line in Week 1. With the Eagles going extremely pass heavy the last two weeks, Smith's ROS outlook is pointing up.\n",

Ridley's usage was encouraging even if his final stat line wasn't eye popping. He's clearly the No. 1 pass catcher in a Falcons offense that will almost always be forced into pass-heavy game script -- a role that will eventually pay dividends for those who drafted Ridley in the second round of redraft leagues. He'll continue to be a far more valuable option in PPR formats than in standard leagues next week against the Jets.\u00a0\n",

So, when Robert's involved, that's a good thing for the Rams offense...We just need to get him some more opportunities and that starts with me.\" Woods has quietly run 129 routes to Cooper Kupp's 144 this year but has totaled just 25 targets (to Kupp's 46) with 58.9 fewer fantasy points (103.1-44.2) than his teammate.

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "The Seahawks face the Rams on Thursday this week but Metcalf should be fine despite a short turnaround. He was listed as a limited participant in practice at the end of last week and showed no signs of the injury versus the 49ers, scoring a touchdown on eight targets. Monday practice reports are also nothing more than estimations by the team's playing on Thursday. The most notable aspect of Seattle's first injury report is Tyler Lockett's absence. Lockett was in and out of practice last week due to a hip issue but is no longer listed. That bodes well for a rebound from the speedster in a projected shootout with the Rams. D'Wayne Eskridge is still dealing with a concussion and could miss Week 5.\u00a0\n",

The Saints need to funnel more deep shots Callaway's way, but coach Sean Payton is understandably petrified of Jameis Winston turning the ball over. The Washington Football Team is a positive Week 5 matchup, one that will create opportunities down the field.\u00a0\n",

Renfrow has settled in as a weekly WR4 in PPR-specific leagues and will be playable when bye weeks start hitting. He gets the Bears in Week 5.\n",

Chase was doing excellent work in tight spaces, winning hand fights and making contested grabs. His college chemistry with Joe Burrow was on full display. Chase did get a little too feisty at one point, drawing an obvious OPI call. Flashing his dominant physical attributes while making big plays, Chase is pushing for every-week WR2 status even with Tee Higgins (shoulder) expected to return for next week's game against the Packers.\u00a0\n",

He responded with the most receiving yards of his career, 52 of which came on a second quarter bomb where he corkscrewed CB Trae Waynes. Finally, some air yards. Shenault was looking dangerous after the catch tonight, frequently making the first man miss. It has been easier said than done with Shenault, but his increased important to the Jags' offense cannot be overstated following Chark's loss. Shenault deserves another WR3 chance for Week 5 against the Titans' undermanned defense.\u00a0\n",

Crowder mostly works close to the line of scrimmage, so his targets aren't super valuable, but volume alone makes him a flex candidate in PPR formats. Against a soft Falcons secondary in Week 5, Crowder is quietly viable.\n",

    "analysis": "Moore suffered the concussion in Week 3, was unable to practice last week, and ultimately missed the Jets' first win of the season last week. In his absence, Corey Davis and Jamison Crowder were on the receiving end of 16 of Zach Wilson's 34 pass attempts versus the Titans. No other Jets player saw more than four targets. Moore should step back into a starting role once healthy but New York's passing attack has been lackluster, to say the least. He will need to show that he's able to garner a large portion of the receiving volume before he can be trusted for fantasy purposes.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Mo Alie-Cox reeled in both of Carson Wentz's passing touchdowns leaving little production to go around for the rest of the receivers. Pittman now has 279 scoreless yards on the year. He's running laps around the rest of the Colts' receivers in terms of volume but he'll need to find the end zone if he's going to become anything more than a fantasy WR3. Indianaoplis will travel to Baltimore next week and it's hard to imagine them putting many points in that matchup. Pittman remains in WR3 territory despite his immense role.\u00a0\n",

Boyd was doing major work after the catch, something that was a theme for the Bengals this evening. Higgins is tentatively expected to return for Week 5, so this receiver corps will return to being a three-man ordeal. Boyd can hopefully count on boosted volume for that matchup, as the Bengals are going to have to throw more often against the Packers.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n",

He also drew a crucial pass interference call, setting up a Jeremy McNichols touchdown.\u00a0\"He does the dirty work for us,\" Tannehill said of Westbrook-Ikhine, who had 144 receptions for 2,226 yards with 16 touchdowns in four seasons at Indiana. \"He gets in there and blocks. He is physical. He is tough. He is a versatile guy who has size and strength, and who has made some big plays for us. I have a ton of confidence in Nick.\" He could be Tennessee's No. 1 wideout in Week 4 against the Jets, though Josh Reynolds' (foot) possible return could throw a wrench in Westbrook-Ikhine's role. He should be considered an option this week in fantasy leagues with multiple flex spots.\u00a0\n",

Brown had a larger role in the Bucs' short pass game with Rob Gronkowski\u00a0out. He'll carry a higher weekly floor for as long as Gronkowski is sidelined.\n",

Uzomah scored on plays of 22 and 31 yards, looking hard to take down in the open field on both occasions. For the first, he caught a perfectly-lofted ball from Burrow on a jailbreak screen. For the second, he got open on a scramble drill and rumbled down the field. The Bengals could certainly use more production from the seam, but tonight hardly seems likely to be the start of a TE2 trend for Uzomah. He does have a plus Week 5 matchup in a Packers defense surrendering the third most tight end fantasy points through three weeks.\u00a0\n",

After a catch-less Week 1, Gesicki has rebounded with no fewer than three receptions and 41 yards in his subsequent games. The Miami offense has looked uninspiring under Brissett but the tight end position falls off precipitously after a few elite options. Gesicki's role makes him a low-end TE1, even with the recent downgrade in quarterback play.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Schultz's team-high eight targets and whopping 36.3% target share were three more than CeeDee Lamb (2/13) accrued from Dak Prescott. It was also the third time this year that Schultz registered six targets, scoring three touchdowns in the last two weeks due to manufactured touches and schemed routes. Blake Jarwin scored an 18-yard touchdown, but Schultz continues to be the player to roster (and a top-five TE) between the two. He'll again rank as a top-five TE in Week 5 against the Giants.\n",

He has the talent to change that, but TE1 relevance is looking miles from possible right now.\u00a0\n",

A concerted effort to use Pitts in the red zone would be a welcomed development for fantasy managers who drafted him in August. You're unlikely to find a better tight end option on your waiver wire for Week 5, when Pitts takes on the Jets.\u00a0\n",

The Bills will roll with Knox and\u00a0Tommy Sweeney as their top-two tight ends entering the regular season. Hollister, who had intermittent fantasy relevance in two years with the Seahawks, will land on a roster. It's also possible, as noted by The Athletic's\u00a0Joe Buscaglia, that the vested veteran is re-signed by the Bills following final cuts. This move would help the Bills avoid season ending IR for an injured player. Hollister\u00a0had four catches for 53 yards in three preseason games this month.\n",

Jared Goff spread the ball around in the Lions' failed comeback attempt, with five receivers going for 30+ yards, but none for 100+. Hockenson had a strong 21% target share in this game, and there should be better days ahead. The third year tight end will be a locked-in TE1 against the Vikings in Week 5.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "While the fantasy points didn't show up for Kittle, his usage was wildly encouraging. He saw 27 percent of the 49ers' targets and could have salvaged his day with a late score. Trey Lance hit him down the middle of the field for a would-be score but Jamal Adams dislodged the ball from his hands. Kittle has more than doubled his target total from the first two weeks of the season in his previous two contests. His volume is trending in the right direction and he'll face the Cardinals in a projected shootout next week. He remains a top-three tight end in a great matchup.\u00a0\n",

Callahan, meanwhile, has a strange fascination with five Bengals pass catchers recording 50 grabs this season. The Athletic's Jay Morrison said Joe Burrow \"established an immediate connection\" with Uzomah in 2020, as the tight end saw five targets in Week 1 and six looks in Week 2 before going down with a season-ending Achilles injury in the first half. Drew Sample started the rest of the season for Cincinnati and ran the 12th most tight end routes on his way to a miserable 4.9 PPR points per game. Uzomah, 28, has been fully cleared and is expected to be a full go for training camp. He should be a popular late-round target in the Bengals' pass-heavy offense.\u00a0\n",

Cameron Brate ran a route on 45% of dropbacks in Week 3, and is expected to fill in at starting tight end if Gronkowski can't go. O.J. Howard, who ran a route on 12% of snaps in Week 3, will likely have a part-time role as well. Arians has indicated that Gronkowski will be a game time decision.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Tucker crushed the 66-yarder as time expired -- the ball bounced off the crossbar and fell through for the win. Tucker's heroics saved the Ravens on a day that saw Marquise Brown drop three touchdowns and Baltimore struggle to get anything going on the ground against a middling Detroit front seven. Tucker has made all 16 of his field goal tries in the final minute of the game over his nine seasons in Baltimore. Tucker doesn't have the fantasy upside he had with the Flacco-era Ravens, but he's still an every-week play in 12-team formats.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Fantasy football's No. 2 kicker in 2020 is cashing in on a profoundly efficient season in which he made 36 of 39 field goal attempts, banging through all 36 of his extra point tries. He established himself as one of the league's big-footed kickers by nailing eight of nine kickers over 50 yards. Sanders' extension includes a $10 million guarantee. His 2020 numbers stand in stark contrast to his 2019 stats, which include seven missed field goals on 30 attempts. Only the Cowboys and Falcons attempted more field goals than Miami in 2020, giving Sanders the opportunity necessary to become a waiver wire darling in fantasy. Sanders will probably be one of the most over-drafted kickers in fantasy football next season.\u00a0\n",

There was some buzz in the first week of August that Blankenship's job was in real danger a year after he logged the fifth most field goals in the NFL. The Colts attempted the fourth most field goals in 2020 -- a key factor in Blankenship's fantasy usefulness. There's no reason to reach for Hot Rod in 2021 drafts, though you could do worse than the second-year kicker in the final round of redraft leagues.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "McPherson, the 149th pick in the 2021 draft, drilled a 50-yarder against Washington in Friday's preseason game -- a kick that would have been good from at least 60 yards. McPherson is the favorite in the team's kicker competition with veteran Austin Seibert, who has also impressed coaches and beat writers this month. The Bengals offense is among the league's most kicker friendly. Last season, Randy Bullock was fantasy's third highest scoring kicker when Joe Burrow went down with a season-ending knee injury. Fantasy managers should consider McPherson if the game's top kickers are off the draft board.\u00a0\n",

Santos is not called on very often from 50-plus yards, making him an extra unlikely recipient of this kind of contract. There's a chance this deal could quickly become an albatross.\u00a0\n",

For his part, Badgley will undoubtedly\u00a0get calls despite his rough recent play.\u00a0\n",
