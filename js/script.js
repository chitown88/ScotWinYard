Mahomes was cruising in the first half, but Kansas City had fewer than 25 yards of second-half offense deep into the fourth quarter with the Raiders harassing Mahomes and making him leave the pocket on most of his throws. He had to contort his body to make a number of throws. The fantasy numbers look great, but Mahomes didn't play all that well, completing just over 51% of his passes. He could have been picked off a couple times as well. The 4-1 Chiefs will head to Buffalo in Week 6, a game that is scheduled to kick off early Monday night.\n",

    "analysis": "It was, by far, the worst game for Allen and the entire Bills offense. Allen had two 2018-level interceptions and missed a few throws that he was making in the first four weeks of the season. As always, Allen did make multiple plays that only a couple of quarterbacks could make, including a rifle to the back of the end zone to T.J. Yeldon. For fantasy purposes, today's game wasn't enough to move him outside of top-five rankings, especially with John Brown expected to return soon and the Chiefs on schedule next. That game should have one of the highest Vegas over/unders of the week. Allen will be an upside QB1.\n",

Fitz scorched Allen for a number of huge gains, while the rest of the 49ers' injury-ravaged secondary did not exactly cover itself in glory. Six different Dolphins pass catchers notched at least one 15-yard reception. The Dolphins could have reached 60 points had they not kept settling for so many field goals in a game that wasn't competitive. Fitz has now had three strong starts and two clunkers through his first five. With the Dolphins intent on letting Tua Tagovailoa develop slowly as he returns from his severe hip injury, Fitzpatrick's immediate job security is not in doubt. Fitz has another Week 6 Cadillac spot in the all-time bad Jets before a bye and Week 8 date with the Rams.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Baltimore's offense ranks 24th in the league through five weeks, one year after finishing as the NFL's No. 2 offense. Jackson, meanwhile, is the QB11 in fantasy football. He's\u00a0averaging a career-low 8.2 rushing attempts per game after running the ball twice in Baltimore's Week 5 blowout win over the Bengals. ESPN's Jamison Hensley said Jackson's \"lack of rushing last game can be attributed to a sore knee,\" though it's unclear how long the knee has bothered him, or how limiting the injury is. He's on pace for 80 designed runs this season -- a steep drop from last year's 116.\u00a0\"As the season goes on, we\u2019re going to see if we need to [run more]. Coach is going to adjust,\" Jackson said.\u00a0\"Right now, we\u2019re doing perfectly fine without me running so much.\" Fantasy managers should continue plugging and playing Jackson with hopes that his rushing production picks up.\u00a0\n",

Walloped for three sacks and many more hits behind a penalty-prone offensive line, Brady was lucky to escape without any interceptions. The game ended on one of the worst mistakes of Brady's career, as he took a reckless chance over the middle of the field. With the Bears celebrating, a bewildered Brady thought the play had occurred\u00a0on third down. It was fourth, and Brady quickly stalked off the field to the locker room. Brady looked every one of his 43 years against one of the league's best defenses. The good news is, his supporting cast now has 10 days to get healthy for next week's showdown with the Packers. Things won't be any easier against Za'Darius Smith and company. Brady will be more of a QB2 than QB1.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Atlanta's Sunday matchup against the Vikings is now in jeopardy. The team has had two players land on the COVID-19 list: rookie defensive tackle Marlon Davidson, who has played in three games, was placed on the list Tuesday, and cornerback A.J. Terrell was placed on the list in September and missed two games. The Falcons ramped up COVID protocols on Wednesday, holding virtual meetings and putting masks on helmets during practice. Fantasy players might have to go without their Vikings and Falcons this week unless the teams can manage to play Monday or Tuesday. There are already two games scheduled for Monday after the league pushed the Bills-Chiefs game from its original Thursday date.\u00a0\n",

And Allen Lazard (core) also missed this one, leaving Marquez Valdes-Scantling, Darrius Shepherd, Robert Tonyan, and Aaron Jones as Rodgers' top pass catchers. Jones caught Rodgers' first score from six yards out in the first quarter, and Tonyan caught the final three with 19-, 8-, and 21-yard scores. Rodgers is cooking right now headed into the bye and would be in the MVP mix if not for Russell Wilson and Josh Allen. Rodgers gets a tough Week 6 road draw against the Bucs.\n",

Moore has filled in as an efficient No. 2 receiver. Bridgewater remains accurate as a passer and now looks more mobile than in previous seasons. The Panthers simply haven't missed Christian McCaffrey because Mike Davis has been so good, but CMC will be returning shortly. Bridgewater has QB2 value for the rest of the season but will be tested by a Bears defense that's limited big plays for years now next week.\n",

    "analysis": "The Saints were playing without their top two corners in Marshon Lattimore and Janoris Jenkins, who were both out with injuries. Completing just 54.8% of his throws at 6.6 yards per attempt is pretty disappointing for Stafford considering the losses of those two. The Lions jumped out to a quick 14-0 lead on the back of D'Andre Swift and Kenny Golladay touchdown catches sandwiched around a Drew Brees interception, but it was all Saints after that with 35 straight points. Stafford's third touchdown was a goal-liner to T.J. Hockenson after Marvin Jones drew a long pass interference call. Stafford has three-straight multi-touchdown games but has yet to top 300 yards this season. The Lions have their bye ahead of a Week 6 date with the Jaguars.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Sunday was already the sixth time Murray eclipsed 300 yards in his budding\u00a0career, finishing with a career-high mark from under center. His two-yard designed rushing score was also his fifth touchdown on the ground, moving him to second in the league among all players\u00a0in rushing scores. The Jets offered minimal pressure throughout, allowing\u00a0the second-year pro to average 10.2 YPA and continue his thriving rapport with DeAndre Hopkins (6/131/1) with ease. Murray even took numerous chances downfield, finding Hopkins in particular for massive gains of 45 and 37 yards in the second half. Next Monday's contest between the Cardinals and Cowboys offers fireworks for all involved.\n",

Foles missed a number of literally wide-open throws, including arguably the worst pass by any quarterback this season.\u00a0Darnell Mooney was free and clear for a 52-yard score after lighting the ground on fire with an unstoppable route, but Foles missed him by 4-5 yards. Foles did experience the upside of inaccuracy in the second half where one throw was so bad it accidentally created a DPI when the receiver tried to turn back for the ball.\u00a0Despite the miscues, Foles' INT probably should have been caught by Allen Robinson. It bounced off A-Rob's chest into Carlton Davis' waiting hands, who turned it into a 34-yard return. Foles was spotted begging Matt Nagy for more tempo on the sideline, but the duo made a number of dubious clock management decisions in the second half. Foles hasn't been any better than Mitchell Trubisky, but the Bears will not be turning back. The Panthers are on tap for Week 6.\u00a0\n",

The question, of course, is Jimmy G's potential effectiveness, as he was a trainwreck against the Dolphins as he had trouble planting his injured back foot. With Aaron Donald and Jalen Ramsey ready to mess with the 49ers' program, Garoppolo is a barely-there QB2 for Week 6.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

Burrow's protection was bad, but his decision-making was equally so, as he routinely held onto the ball for too long. He took more than one thundering sack from behind. Burrow was lucky to escape with only two turnovers. His interception was a horrible decision vs. a free rusher, as he \"threw the ball away\" off his back foot over the middle of the field. It was easily picked off over a disinterested A.J. Green. Burrow took such a pounding that the Bengals almost exclusively ran the ball in fourth quarter garbage time, saving Burrow and setting up a field goal to prevent a shutout. Today was a humbling reminder of how far Burrow has to go, and how difficult it will be to get there behind this group of blockers. Things won't get any easier against the Colts next Sunday.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

Eagles RT Lane Johnson (ankle) left before halftime and did not return, exacerbating the pressure Pittsburgh was able to generate. Wentz's final interception was on a hail mary throw so that one can be discounted but the first turnover came on an errant throw. He's thrown nine interceptions through five games. Wentz isn't in danger of losing his job yet but his team only has one win on the year. The schedule doesn't get any easier next week with Baltimore on the horizon.

The play of the game was Henry's stiff arm that broke the internet and arguably took CB Josh Norman's soul from his body. It's his signature move. After today's game, Henry is averaging 25.25 carries per game and is on pace for a 1,504-16 rushing line, which is almost identical to last year's (1,540-16).

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "With Leonard Fournette (ankle) still sidelined, RoJo had his second 100-yard game on the ground in five days. Jones cleared 50 yards both halves, but he could have had a bigger night had the Bucs not been so penalty prone, especially after the break. Bucs miscues were constantly taking them out of favorable run script even as they played most of the game with a narrow lead. Jones should have had a receiving score near the end of the first quarter, but he was mystifyingly ruled down at the end of a catch he made more difficult than it needed to be. Mike Evans then quickly punched it in for a two-yard touchdown. Jones is complementing his big plays on early downs with just enough mistakes that he cannot be considered safely distanced from Fournette, who should be ready for next week's showdown with the Packers. RoJo will be best utilized as a FLEX for that one.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "It's, of course, possible Bell does far more than threaten CEH's No. 1 status. He could take it outright, though it won't happen in Week 6. Bell is ineligible to play against the Bills on Monday because of the NFL's COVID-19 guidelines. He will make his debut in Week 7 vs. the Broncos. Bell arrives as Edwards-Helaire has finished under 65 yards rushing in four straight games, failing to average more than 4.0 yards per carry in any contest since Week 1. Bell's arrival is particularly bad news since, at least in theory, he is also a well above-average pass-catching back. Bell will be a threat on all three downs, and it is up to CEH to make a stand beginning Monday against Buffalo. Realistically, CEH will probably begin in the RB20-28 range for Week 7, with Bell likely to get an immediate shot on early downs/in the red zone. It will then be a week-by-week affair from there.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Montgomery's score was a rugged three-yarder in the second quarter, but it was an otherwise forgettable night. Montgomery's limited explosiveness was on display multiple times as he struggled to turn cuts and jukes into extra yardage. Montgomery continues to not show great quicks. He has seen his passing-game usage skyrocket in Tarik Cohen's absence, combining for 13 targets over his past two games, though he hasn't done much with the looks. Despite his lack of competition and locked-in weekly volume, Montgomery is going to have trouble rising above low-end RB2 status. The Panthers are a plus matchup for Week 6.\u00a0\n",

Chase Edmonds received the next carry and exploded through\u00a0the middle for a 29-yard touchdown. Drake also received one target, bringing his total on the year to six, and looked every bit the part of his 3.2 yards per touch, saving his fantasy day with a two-yard goal line score. Edmonds, who got eight touches, has to be in consideration to overthrow Drake soon. The latter will be a usage-based RB3 in next week's contest against Dallas.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Johnson, who has been limited to only 3-of-5 games by injury, saw the ball just four times in Crennel's Week 5 debut. \"We know what Duke brings to the table, we like what Duke brings to the table,\" Crennel claimed. \"Next week, Duke might be the guy who shows up more in the receiving game and running game as well.\" It makes sense in theory, but the problem for Duke has been the same all season: Where he excels, pass catching, has also always been David Johnson's primary strength. That may no longer be true, but Duke will essentially have to commit a hostile takeover of passing downs to earn a consistent role. Even in PPR leagues, Duke is not currently a viable FLEX.\u00a0\n",

He also saw four targets but only managed to bring down two of them for 19 yards. Sanders got one chance to show off his game-breaking speed and made the most of it but the rest of the day was quiet for him. Because of Philly has been playing from behind consistently this year, Sanders should be expected to get scripted out of games where he doesn't break a long run. He's a highly volatile RB1 moving forward.\n",

    "analysis": "The good news is Harris' 17 carries were a new season-high mark for any Patriots\u00a0back this season. The bad news is that he was essentially used like Sony Michel, strictly running the ball on his 22 snaps and playing behind both James White and Rex Burkhead in the receiving game. The 23-year-old still teased explosiveness in capping the third quarter with a 41-yard run. New England's gameplan entails attacking opponents on the ground until Cam Newton (COVID) returns, which bodes well for Harris moving forward. He's an RB3/4\u00a0in a pinch for those who need to fill-in for\u00a0bye weeks or injuries in Week 5.\n",

    "analysis": "His yards and targets were both season-high numbers. Hilton commanded a 30.3% target share ahead of Trey Burton (6, 18.1%) but still left meat on the bone for a variety of reasons \u2014 one drop, overthrows\u00a0from Philip Rivers, and a target that turned into a walk-in pick-six for backup S Ronnie Harrison. Meanwhile Marcus Johnson and Ashton Dulin were schemed wide open downfield for a 36- and 34-yard gain from the slot. Simply put, Hilton lacks both the opportunity downfield and raw targets in what will typically be\u00a0a run-first scheme. He'll be ranked as a WR3 in a softer matchup against Cincinnati next week.\n",

Buffalo continues to be among the most pass-heavy teams in the NFL under OC Brian Daboll, and it's been enough to vault Diggs into weekly top-12 fantasy rankings.

An uneven Lamar Jackson missed Brown on what probably should have been a 31-yard touchdown in the first quarter, while Jackson cut short a number of drives with questionable decision-making and an inability to find his second read. Brown also couldn't quite corral what would have been a 27-yard score later on. Nevertheless, the Ravens still managed to build a big lead against the overmatched Bengals, and by the time Brown's statline was positioned to go next level in the second half, the Ravens no longer had to pass the ball. So far not rising above the WR2/3 borderline, Brown should see a heavy dose of Philadelphia's Darius Slay in Week 6.\u00a0\n",

Williams ate Allen alive for a 47-yard gain on the Dolphins' first play from scrimmage and was off to the races. Williams' score was a 32-yarder where he split the safeties near the goal line. A huge, needed effort, especially since it involved Williams out-targeting Isaiah Ford 5-2. It's far from \"case closed\" on Williams' return, but this certainly gets him back in the WR3 mix for plus matchups like next week's date with the laughingstock Jets.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Samuel's eight looks tied George Kittle for the team lead, though most of them were off-target from the awful duo of Jimmy Garoppolo and C.J. Beathard. Playing through an ankle injury, Jimmy G apparently wasn't at full health, and his confidence seemed to be lacking as a result. The eight targets are good news after Samuel drew only three in his 2020 debut last week, but that number is probably Samuel's ceiling for the time being. Nothing in the 49ers' offense feels settled. Samuel will offer a low Week 6 floor vs. the Rams.\u00a0\n",

Clearly the team's No. 2 wideout ahead of Andy Isabella (2/30) and Fitzgerald, Kirk remains a volatile WR3/4 who finds himself in a salivating matchup against Dallas' cornerbacks room in Week 6.\n",

He owned Carlton Davis' soul with a devastating plant-and-go at the mid-point of a route on the first play of the second quarter, but Nick Foles missed him by 4-5 yards for what should have been a walk-in 52-yard touchdown. It would have been the biggest gain of the year for a first-year pro who has shown a little something each week. Slowly working his way past Anthony Miller on the depth chart, Mooney won't provide consistent re-draft value in the Bears' inept passing attack, but he's an exciting Dynasty league stash.\u00a0\n",

Brown was inactive Tuesday against the Titans, leading to a 100 percent snap share for WR Gabriel Davis, who caught five of nine targets for 58 yards. A full Thursday practice means Brown is on track to play Monday against Kansas City in what is likely to be a high-scoring affair. Brown is a WR3 option with upside in an excellent game environment this week.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Coming off back-to-back 1/15 efforts, Gesicki revived on the back of a 70-yard reception where he simply ran by the second level of the 49ers' defense. The problem, of course, is that Gesicki generated only 21 yards on his four other grabs, but it was a reminder of his big-play ability as a pseudo receiver for the Dolphins' passing attack. With tight end as shallow as ever, Gesicki will be a no-brainer, back-end TE1 for Week 6 against the Jets.\u00a0\n",

To be fair, Hurst was missed twice in the red zone by Matt Ryan, who has looked brutal without Julio Jones. For fantasy, there's really nowhere to go if you're rostering Hurst. There's likely nobody on the waiver wire seeing more targets per game (5.6) than Hurst, especially when you factor in the upside of this Atlanta offense. He regrettably will be on the TE1/2 border against the Vikings in Week 6.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Hooper's involvement in Cleveland's offense has progressively increased with every start\u00a0this year, allowing him 4,\u00a07, and 10 targets over the last three\u00a0games in particular. His 27% target share against Indianapolis was unsurprisingly a season-high mark. Given the lack of depth at tight end this year, Hooper has suddenly become a fringe TE1 for those struggling to fill his position. David Njoku isn't a threat to the key free agent acquisition moving forward,\n",
