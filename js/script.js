Murray's passing scores were a 41-yard strike to A.J. Green where AJG just beat the defense down the field and a 14-yarder to emerging TE2 consideration Maxx Williams. Murray has played at an MVP level as the Cards have raced to a 4-0 record despite some sloppy mistakes. They are dangerous enough on offense right now to overcome penalties and time management miscues. The reeling 49ers are a wild card Week 5 matchup.\u00a0 \u00a0\n",

FOX television cameras found Stafford's throwing hand being examined and taped up on the sideline near the end of the first half. He then went into overdrive after the break, piling up 234 yards and his score, a 13-yard strike to Tyler Higbee. Higbee easily destroyed S Jamal Adams in coverage, and Stafford dropped in a layup. Stafford's first half pick was a truly horrendous end zone attempt where he was trying to throw the ball away. The biggest storyline of the evening was Stafford finally striking up a connection with Robert Woods, whom he found for 12 grabs and 150 yards. Stafford thankfully has 10 days to get his throwing hand right for a Week 6 matchup with the Giants.\u00a0\n",

The Cowboys moved the ball at will without CeeDee Lamb (2/13) making a significant impact, calling manufactured plays for Dalton Schultz (5/50/1) while getting 204 combined rushing yards from Ezekiel Elliott (19/142/1) and Tony Pollard (9/62). Amari Cooper also beat C.J. Henderson one-on-one for a 35-yard touchdown following a perfectly placed ball dime Prescott in the third. The only downside to Dallas' passing offense at this time is the fact Prescott hasn't been asked or needed to throw more than 27 attempts in three consecutive games. Even so, he'll stay a top-five option in next week's soft matchup against the Giants.\n",

    "analysis": "The 400-yard game was the first of third-year pro Jones' career, and came despite Sterling Shepard and Darius Slayton sitting on the shelf with hamstring issues. Jones was buoyed by big-time YAC efforts from Saquon Barkley, Kadarius Toney and Kenny Golladay, who each drew at least six targets. Jones' \"interception\" was a first half Hail Mary. Jones was making big-time throws and giving his wideouts space to make plays. He has unquestionably appeared better this season while cutting down on his turnovers. A potential Week 5 shootout with the Cowboys looms as a massive test.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Sunday marked the second time in Jackson's regular season career he's eclipsed 300 passing yards, and it could've been much more if not for a holding penalty that negated a 30-yard Mark Andrews touchdown grab. Between that called-back score and Marquise Brown's three dropped touchdowns in Week 4, Jackson's passing numbers should look far better than they do through the season's first month. Jackson played conservatively for much of the game against a vicious Denver defense that pressured L-Jax on nearly every drop back. The safe play paid off against a Broncos team that stood no chance of scoring after Teddy Bridgewater exited the contest with a brain injury. The Ravens get four home games in a row starting in Week 5 against the Colts. Jackson will again be an elite QB1 option.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Carr was in the MVP conversation headed into this one, but this game pretty much put an end to that talk. He was 7-of-13 for 52 scoreless yards at halftime with the Raiders trailing 21-0. Carr tried to guide the Raiders back with third-quarter touchdowns to Hunter Renfrow and Darren Waller, but a costly fourth-quarter interception put an end to Vegas' hopes. The throw went to a completely covered Waller and was picked off by Derwin James. Carr has two touchdowns in every game to this point and gets another tougher draw in Week 5 against the Bears on a short week. Carr will be more of a middling QB2 in that one for fantasy.\n",

Herbert's touchdowns all came in the red zone with four-, 10-, and 14-yard hookups to Donald Parham, Jared Cook, and Austin Ekeler. One throw Herbert would've liked to have back was a would-be 82-yard touchdown to Mike Williams that Herbert badly overthrew when CB Damon Arnette was absolutely roasted off the line. With the Chargers up just 21-14 in the fourth quarter, Herbert completed a 4th-and-2 throw to Jared Cook to keep the drive going and get Ekeler into the end zone again later to give the Chargers a lead they wouldn't relinquish after the momentum was tilting in the Raiders' favor. Herbert has a perfect 7:0 TD:INT mark in wins over the Chiefs and Raiders the last two weeks. The 3-1 Chargers host the Browns in Week 5.\n",

Brady's five touchdowns were a 10-yard hookup to Giovani Bernard followed by two to Antonio Brown and then another two to Mike Evans. Brown's were from 62 and four yards out, while Evans' scores were 34- and 22-yard hookups in the fourth quarter. Brady has now thrown four-plus touchdowns three times in the first five weeks and will head to Philadelphia as an obvious top-tier fantasy QB1 next week.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "The Bengals took their first lead as time expired in the fourth quarter, with Evan McPherson kicking the game-winning field goal after Burrow found TE C.J. Uzomah for yet another big play. With Tee Higgins (shoulder) on the shelf for his second and apparently final game, Burrow predictably peppered Tyler Boyd and Ja'Marr Chase with targets. Boyd did work after the catch with Chase making tough grabs in traffic. Uzomah was the X factor, however, getting free over the middle of the field and rolling toward the end zone like a bowling ball en route to 5/95/2. Burrow set season highs across the board this evening, with the 300-yard effort being his first of 2021. He averaged an eye-popping 10.9 yards on his 32 attempts, thanks in part to his pass catchers' YAC work. Burrow has been passing the eye test even as the Bengals work to limit his volume coming off his ACL tear. He's going to have to air it out in next week's home showdown with the Packers.\u00a0\n",

Moore (8/113/2) for six- and eight-yard scores before the final whistle.

George Kittle's (calf, doubtful) absence is concerning since the 27-year-old is graded as Pro Football Focus' No. 3 pass-blocking tight end this year, but Trent Williams' full bill of health in practice should mask that. With seven carries in 30 minutes during last week's loss to Seattle, Lance's rushing floor as a low-end QB1 offsets the volatility of his (potential) inaccuracy if he struggles through the air. Note that this total (49) against the Cardinals has plummeted a full 4.5 points since initially opening at 53.5 on PointsBet.\n",

Rodgers is still insanely efficient, tossing eight touchdowns the last three weeks after a two-interception Week 1 disaster. Rodgers added a third score on the ground with a four-yard scamper in the second quarter. Both of Rodgers' passing scores went to Randall Cobb from 23 and one yard(s) out. Rodgers is a borderline QB1/2 most weeks in fantasy; he doesn't have high-number passing days and barely uses his legs anymore. Rodgers gets a road date with the Bengals in Week 5.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Both of Brissett's touchdowns came in the fourth quarter after the Colts had already taken a three-score lead. The veteran passer finally began to take downfield shots but it was too little too late as the game had been out of reach for some time by that point. Brissett added a trio of carries for eight yards on the ground. Through a little less than three games of action, Brissett is averaging just 4.9 yards per pass attempt and is getting sacked three times per game. He gets a potentially exciting matchup with the Bucs next week but it's impossible to find a sense of optimism after watching his poor play in relief of Tua Tagoaviloa. He's a weak option at quarterback even in Superflex leagues.\n",

The bad news is that it explains why Mayfield has played so poorly the past two weeks, completing 53.1% of his passes for 6.2 yards per attempt while missing wide open receivers streaking across the field. Mayfield reportedly doesn't need surgery and will continue playing through the ailment, which could be spun as detrimental to the team rather than heroic. Case Keenum will undoubtedly come off the bench if Mayfield continues to struggle.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Nagy was painfully slow to commit to Fields as his starter, but he finally made the right call, handing the offense over to his promising rookie quarterback. Fields has just four designed rush attempts over the last two weeks, so there's plenty of meat on the bone in his deployment as a runner. In spot duty Weeks 1-2 Fields carried the ball seven times on designed runs, so there's some reason for optimism that the Bears will better utilize their mobile starter. Fields will be a QB2 in Week 5 against a Raiders defense with Pro Football Focus' top graded pass rush. To start him, fantasy managers will need to take a leap of faith that Matt Nagy will provide Fields with the ability to generate rushing value in a difficult matchup. Bears' wide receivers are likely to be inconsistent with a rookie under center. Considering that Andy Dalton has the lowest aDOT in the NFL, inconsistent value is an upgrade.\n",

    "analysis": "Henderson came out and dominated first quarter work before giving the Rams and fantasy managers a scare when he seemed to injure his left arm. Sony Michel dominated touches the remainder of the half, but Henderson was never officially announced with an injury and thankfully resurfaced looking no worse for the wear after the break. His five-yard touchdown rumble came on a stretch play cutback early in the third quarter. Henderson has looked laterally explosive since returning from his ribs issue, but he continues to give the Rams reason to doubt his ability to hold up on big workloads. He will nevertheless remain a high-end RB2 for Week 6 against the Giants.\u00a0\n",

Moss did dominate red zone carries over Devin Singletary, five to one, but was stuffed on a key third-and-1 at the Houston 3, forcing one of the many field goals for Buffalo. It looks like Moss is probably the more reliable option of the two at this point if only because of the red zone work, but the uncertainty leaves Moss stapled to RB3/FLEX territory. Even with a tempting Chiefs matchup next Sunday night.\u00a0\n",

When Chubb isn\u2019t finding the end zone, his stat lines leave a lot to be desired in fantasy with his empty pass-game role. Chubb was stuffed at the goal line in the first half before Kareem Hunt (14-69-1) converted from one yard out a few plays later for the Browns\u2019 lone touchdown. Chubb will be a TD-dependent RB1 next week at the Chargers.\n",

Despite dealing with a\u00a0 handful of injuries to key players, the Lions are entering Week 5 with most of their notable offensive options available. Expect Swift and Williams to continue splitting the backfield. Swift has seen the majority of the red zone looks and has out-targeted Williams 29-14 through four weeks. He sits on the RB1 borderline while Williams is a middling RB3.\u00a0\n",

He was doing yeoman's work, tacking on Capital T Tough yardage after first contact. That includes near the goal line, where he scored a six-yarder after a textbook plant-and-cut. He followed up with a four-yarder where he pile drove to the plane. Robinson was one of the main reasons the Jags almost snapped their 18-game losing streak. Regardless of Hyde's health, Robinson has taken back complete control of the Jags' backfield after coach Urban Meyer tried every other option first. He will be a locked-in RB2 for Week 5 vs. the Titans.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Ekeler sent fantasy players into a panic when he left the field early in the first quarter with a noticeable limp that sent him to the blue medical tent, but he quickly returned and posted his first 100-yard rushing game of the year, matching a season-high with 15 carries. Ekeler's first touchdown was a 14-yard catch where he straight whooped LB K.J. Wright in coverage, and his second was an 11-yard run in the fourth quarter to put L.A. ahead 28-14. Ekeler has four touchdowns in four games to start the year and is an every-week RB1 ahead of a Week 5 date with the Browns.\n",

He's averaging 13.75 carries per game for 46.25 yards on the ground each week, but Harris did punch in his first rushing touchdown with a one-yarder in the fourth quarter in this one. Harris has a whopping 26 catches through four weeks. Harris will be a volume-based RB1 next week against the Broncos.\n",

Rodney Smith's usage in the receiving game came out of left field, though, out-targeting Hubbard 5-2 in what was essentially a blowout game script for the entire fourth quarter; having registered four of his five targets while the Panthers were trailing by two scores, it's possible Smith was only in the game for that reason. It didn't help that Hubbard was also vultured by his own quarterback inside the red zone, seeing Sam Darnold plow ahead for 11- and one-yard rushing scores. Hubbard will still rank as a touch-based RB2 against Philadelphia in Week 5 given the injury-riddled landscape of his position.\n",

The first was a 54-yard reception where some play-calling deception got Barkley free down the left sideline. He then looked a wide receiver with his speed making the house call. Barkley's second score was a walk-off, six-yard rush in overtime. He took a read option and got real skinny through the hole, making an excellent cut. There were a few times where Barkley seemed like he was trying to do too much \u2014 including spinning into a fumble the Giants thankfully recovered \u2014 but he continued his trend of looking more explosive each week. The Giants' awful line is going to lead to some volatility, but Barkley is already deserving of being a weekly fixture in the RB1 ranks, including Week 5 against Dallas.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Gibson is dealing with a stress fracture in his shin but he's already played through it at least once. He should continue to see his normal workload versus the Saints this week. J.D. McKissic remains involved in the offense, keeping Gibson from being a locked-in RB1 option. Even with McKissic stealing touches, Gibson has managed 16.8 touches per game, most of which have come on the ground. He projects as a high-end RB2 versus the Saints this week.\u00a0\n",

His highlight of the day was a 23-yard touchdown run in the first half. Taylor also caught all three of his targets for 11 yards. Marlon Mack earned a surprising 10 carries after being shopped on the trade market all week. Despite his boost in volume, Taylor backers shouldn't be concerned. He entered the game with a knee injury and the bulk of Mack's work came in the closing minutes of the game. Taylor remains an RB1 versus the Ravens next week.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Mitchell has missed the last two games with his shoulder issue, allowing Trey Sermon to handle 29 carries for 120 yards and one touchdown with two catches for three yards in the passing game. Sermon hasn't looked all that good in his extended chance as the starter. Mitchell should return to the top of the depth chart, but this backfield is going to be a weekly headache. In hindsight, Mitchell may not have been worth all that FAAB on waiver wires in fantasy.\n",

There was nothing flashy for Murray, who banged and bashed and plodded his way to 59 yards, much of it after Baltimore had seized a comfortable lead. He saw no pass game involvement against the Broncos. Le'Veon Bell -- made active for the first time this season -- handled just four carries. Murray appears to be the back to roster going forward. He'll be an interesting RB2/3 play next week against the Colts.\u00a0\n",

With a massive workload up for grabs, Williams should be in line for RB2 fantasy numbers until Montgomery returns.\n",

Hunt has now rushed for touchdowns in back-to-back games while Chubb has been held out of the end zone in two straight contests after scoring Weeks 1 and 2.

Weird game to read into. It's worth noting that Zack Moss was the first back on the field and that he had five red zone carries to Singletary's one. Singletary remains a RB3/FLEX play at best until his platoon with Moss resolves one way or another.\u00a0\n",

Tevin Coleman was a distant third behind Carter and Johnson, seeing just three touches in a matchup with his former team. Carter should continue to see the most carries going forward, but the Jets' backfield is a situation to avoid.\n",

Collins -- who ran a route on 58 percent of Seattle's drop backs -- salvaged his PPR fantasy day with two late receptions for 25 yards to go along with his 15 carries for 47 yards. Though DeeJay Dallas ate into Collins' pass catching work, it's clear Collins is something close to a workhorse when Carson is sidelined. Carson has ten days to get right before the Seahawks take on the Steelers in Week 6.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Rookie Kenneth Gainwell has been the team's most effective backfield option through the season's first month, outplaying Sanders in Week 4 with 31 rushing yards, six receptions for 58 yards, and a touchdown. Gainwell, who headed into Week 4 splitting pass-catching duties with Sanders, seemed to take over as Nick Sirriani's preferred running back in two-minute drills and third downs. Sanders has seen more than 60 percent of the Eagles' offensive snaps in each of their first four games, positioning him as the lead back for now. Both Philly RBs will be tough to trust in Week 5 against Carolina.\u00a0\n",

Ceding work to Brown has been the norm for Gaskin this year but he also failed to see a target after seeing 16 looks in the passing game in his first three outings of the year. Brown and Ahmed combined for three targets. Miami couldn't mount much of an offense but Gaskins' role is the bigger concern. If he isn't involved as a receiver going forward, he'll be dusted for fantasy purposes. He's an easy stay-away in a grueling matchup with the Bucs next week.\u00a0\n",

Dare Ogunbowale will take on the backup duties for this game. Ogunbowale is a capable pass-catcher and contributes on special teams but doesn't figure to eat into Robinson's rushing role as much as Hyde would have.

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "\"Neck\" didn't seem like a body part that was terribly likely to be overcome on a short week. The fact that Carson has avoided injured reserve, at least so far, does bode well for his odds of a Week 6 return. In his Thursday night absence, Alex Collins will be the Seahawks' early-down leader against a Rams defense that has been giving on the ground. Collins should see enough touches to get himself in the RB2 mix, though Travis Homer could steal some carries while perhaps/probably operating as the primary passing-down back. Joining Carson on the shelf are\u00a0CB John Reid, OT Jake Curhan, OT Stone Forsythe and DL Robert Nkemdiche.\u00a0\n",

The Patriots have continued punishing rookie\u00a0Rhamondre Stevenson, keeping him inactive since his Week 1 fumble.

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "McKissic was again used over Antonio Gibson in the team's two-minute offense and on most third downs. He caught a late pass from Taylor Heinicke on a playground-like play where the QB threw all the way across the field to McKissic, who broke a tackle, ran down the sideline, and skied into the end zone for the game winning touchdown. McKissic's role is just big enough to start him in 12-team PPR leagues. He should be a high-end RB3 in Week 5 against the Saints.\u00a0\n",

Ruggs also drew a long DPI call earlier in the night to set up an eventual Darren Waller touchdown. Ruggs has seen target counts of 5, 7, 7, and 6 to start his sophomore year.

    "analysis": "Moore's two touchdowns while CB Trevon Diggs (back) was sidelined in garbage time against Dallas shouldn't overshadow the former's 12 targets in back-to-back games, leading the team with a 30.7% target share from Sam Darnold. He was also stopped at the one-yard line on a target inside the 10 during Carolina's second possession, setting up the first of Sam Darnold's two rushing scores on the day. With double-digit targets in three consecutive games, Moore's volume is in no danger of disappearing any time soon \u2014 especially with Christian McCaffrey (hamstring) sidelined for the next 2-3 games. Moore will again rank as a low-end WR1 in Week 5 against the Eagles.\n",

His 67 yards were actually his most since Week 1, however, which tells you all you need to know about his limited production to begin the season. Hopkins has not scored since Week 2 and is averaging 56 yards. His rib issue has surely played a part. He will have a woefully-undermanned 49ers secondary to feast on for Week 5, keeping him in the WR1 ranks.\u00a0\n",

The Raiders appeared to stick CB Casey Hayward on him a lot of the night. Williams will bounce back and remains a WR1/2 in fantasy ahead of a Week 5 date with Cleveland.\n",

Brown this week at least, so Ryan Tannehill won't have to rely on Nick Westbrook-Ikhine as his No. 1 wide receiver like he did in Week 4. With at least one of their top wide receiver out this week though, the Titans are likely to run their offense through Derrick Henry in a matchup with a Jaguars defense that should allow them to do so. Jones will attempt to make his return in Week 6 against the Bills on MNF.\n",

    "analysis": "Darlington added that Parker woke up with tightness in his hamstring and will not test it any further in warmups. With Will Fuller also out, Jaylen Waddle is going to be showered with targets. He vaults into WR2 territory while Mike Gesicki, who has been heavily targeted by Jacoby Brissett, is a locked-in TE1 this week. Albert Wilson and Preston Williams will both be tasked with larger roles this week.\u00a0\n",

The Rams are going to need both wideouts cooking at once, not simply trading off. Now having more than stabilized his WR3 floor, Woods can hopefully resume his drive for weekly WR2 status in Week 6 vs. the Giants.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Darius Slayton (hamstring) is also out for Week 5. Shepard's and Slayton's injuries will open up playing time for Kadarius Toney and John Ross. Toney was impressive in his Week 4 starting debut and will look to build on his success in a difficult matchup with the Cowboys. If Toney succeeds, it's possible that he eats into Shepard's snaps going forward. Or, more likely, pushes Shepard into an out-wide role in some 3WR sets. Shepard is at his best in the slot and the emergence of the Giants' first round pick would not be a positive development for his fantasy value.\n",

That does not tell the whole story of his Week 5, however, as his 10 looks were his second most of the season and he was inches away from a much bigger night. The biggest what if? was a should-have-been 69-yard touchdown in the third quarter. Lockett was all alone but a pressured Russell Wilson barely missed his No. 2 wideout. The quarterback was hurt in the process, spraining his finger and giving way to Geno Smith. Lockett was the intended target on Smith's game-sealing interception, falling down and giving the defense an easy grab. Even if it is Smith for Week 6 against the Steelers, Lockett will be impossible to fade out of the top 24.\u00a0\n",

Chase was doing excellent work in tight spaces, winning hand fights and making contested grabs. His college chemistry with Joe Burrow was on full display. Chase did get a little too feisty at one point, drawing an obvious OPI call. Flashing his dominant physical attributes while making big plays, Chase is pushing for every-week WR2 status even with Tee Higgins (shoulder) expected to return for next week's game against the Packers.\u00a0\n",

The Titans are a terrific defense to start Shenault against anyhow since they've allowed the second-most fantasy points per game to opposing wideouts.\n",

He is physical. He is tough. He is a versatile guy who has size and strength, and who has made some big plays for us. I have a ton of confidence in Nick.\" He could be Tennessee's No. 1 wideout in Week 4 against the Jets, though Josh Reynolds' (foot) possible return could throw a wrench in Westbrook-Ikhine's role.

Robinson's three targets were good for an 18% target share in a Week where the Bears attempted just 17 passes. His fantasy managers will have to hope for additional passing volume when the Bears face the Raiders in Week 5. Robinson remains at least a WR3 based on talent alone.\n",

    "analysis": "That would put Jeudy in line to take the field between Week 7 and Week 8. His initial timetable had him sidelined for as many as eight weeks but Fangio noted that his recovery has been going well. The Broncos play the Browns on Thursday Night Football in Week 7 so the latter of the two weeks mentioned is a more realistic target. Jeudy has been out since Week 1 with a high-ankle sprain and is currently on injured reserve. With K.J. Hamler already done for the year due to a torn ACL, Courtland Sutton and Tim Patrick have been getting the bulk of the work at receiver. Expect both players to be targeted heavily until Jeudy returns.\u00a0\n",

That number is now down to four 4.5, but one dud won't be enough to plunge Kirk from the WR4 ranks. You just have to remember what kind of player he is when you plug him into your lineup. Kirk will come with plenty of upside for an appetizing Week 5 matchup with the 49ers' undermanned secondary.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "With Shepard and Slayton sidelined Sunday against the Saints, Jason Garrett's offense was uncharacteristically aggressive, logging eight plays of more than 20 yards -- a stark departure from the team's usual dink-and-dunk approach. Daniel Jones attempted five passes of more than 20 yards in Week 4 after throwing seven deep balls in the season's first three weeks. The blazing fast combo of Ross -- who had three grabs for 77 yards and a touchdown -- and Toney -- who gained 78 yards on six receptions -- gave New York's offense a threatening element it hasn't had in Garrett's time as offensive coordinator. \"The big question is if the Giants will begin to operate the way they did in the final seven minutes of regulation and overtime, or if they\u2019ll revert to their conservative form when they aren\u2019t in desperation mode,\" Duggan said. Toney remains the more reliable PPR option this week against the Cowboys. The eventual return of Shepard and Slayton could make the Giants' receiver room a mess for fantasy purposes.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "With Robert Woods finally revived for 14 targets behind Cooper Kupp's 10, there wasn't much work for Jefferson and DeSean Jackson to go around. It was D-Jax who made the Rams' big stretch play of the week, embarrassing Jamal Adams for a 68-yard grab before running out of gas on what might have been an 80-yard touchdown. Jefferson has cleared 80 yards twice in five contests and been held under 20 twice. There won't be much rhyme or reason to has WR5 success.\u00a0\n",

Uzomah scored on plays of 22 and 31 yards, looking hard to take down in the open field on both occasions. For the first, he caught a perfectly-lofted ball from Burrow on a jailbreak screen. For the second, he got open on a scramble drill and rumbled down the field. The Bengals could certainly use more production from the seam, but tonight hardly seems likely to be the start of a TE2 trend for Uzomah. He does have a plus Week 5 matchup in a Packers defense surrendering the third most tight end fantasy points through three weeks.\u00a0\n",

The Chiefs defense is another compelling argument to at least put him in the streaming conversation for Week 5.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

The Browns are likely to run the ball as much as possible against a Chargers defense built to be run on, so even if Njoku plays he'll be tough to start in fantasy. If Njoku can't go it should open up additional targets for Austin Hooper and Harrison Bryant.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Waller's first catch went for 21 yards and was easily the Raiders' biggest play of the first half when Derek Carr produced just 52 yards in the first 30 minutes. But Waller's monster catch was a three-yard Randy Moss-like grab over the top of S Nasir Adderley in the third quarter to pull the Raiders within seven at 21-14. It was Waller's first touchdown since Week 1. After his 19-target opener, Waller has seen exactly seven targets in three straight games. He'll be a top-five TE1 next week against the Bears.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "This was the best game of the season for Pitts, who led the Falcons in receiving and targets with Calvin Ridley out.\u00a0Pitts scored the first touchdown of his career on a goal-line play where he beat the coverage to the outside. The Falcons' usage of Pitts has been up, with 19 of his 36 targets coming in the last two weeks, an encouraging sign for his ROS outlook.\u00a0Pitts will get a tougher test for a matchup with the Dolphins secondary after Atlanta's Week 6 bye.\n",

The Bills will roll with Knox and\u00a0Tommy Sweeney as their top-two tight ends entering the regular season. Hollister, who had intermittent fantasy relevance in two years with the Seahawks, will land on a roster. It's also possible, as noted by The Athletic's\u00a0Joe Buscaglia, that the vested veteran is re-signed by the Bills following final cuts. This move would help the Bills avoid season ending IR for an injured player. Hollister\u00a0had four catches for 53 yards in three preseason games this month.\n",

Brate was targeted six times in Week 4, making him a worthwhile streaming option for fantasy teams in need of some tight end production. O.J.

Graham will still play, especially in the red zone, but he's now the TE2 in what should be a subpar passing offense (especially as long as Andy Dalton remains under center).\n",

Callahan, meanwhile, has a strange fascination with five Bengals pass catchers recording 50 grabs this season. The Athletic's Jay Morrison said Joe Burrow \"established an immediate connection\" with Uzomah in 2020, as the tight end saw five targets in Week 1 and six looks in Week 2 before going down with a season-ending Achilles injury in the first half. Drew Sample started the rest of the season for Cincinnati and ran the 12th most tight end routes on his way to a miserable 4.9 PPR points per game. Uzomah, 28, has been fully cleared and is expected to be a full go for training camp. He should be a popular late-round target in the Bengals' pass-heavy offense.\u00a0\n",

Brate was targeted six times in Week 4, making him a worthwhile streaming option for fantasy teams in need of some tight end production. O.J. Howard was targeted just once and appears to be an afterthought in the offense, even with Gronk out.\u00a0\n",

Higbee humiliated Jamal Adams on his 13-yard scoring grab in the third quarter. There was a scary moment in the first half where Higbee ran off the field with his left arm dangling at his side. It is possible something was popped back into place on the sideline. Higbee rarely leaves the field, but he hasn't come close to commanding true TE1 targets behind Cooper Kupp and Robert Woods. He is probably best left on the TE1/2 borderline for Week 6 against the Giants.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Njoku is in a three-man tight end committee, but the mere fact that he sees deep targets puts him on the streaming radar. The Browns are likely to run the ball as much as possible against a Chargers defense built to be run on, so even if Njoku plays he'll be tough to start in fantasy. If Njoku can't go it should open up additional targets for Austin Hooper and Harrison Bryant.\n",

Carlson converted 94.3 percent of his 2020 field goal attempts after he was a far worse 73.1 percent in 2019. Carlson was 4-of-4 beyond 50 yards last season as he quietly finished as fantasy's fourth highest scoring kicker thanks largely to the NFL's seventh most attempts. He'll likely be overdrafted in seasonal leagues this season. Coach Jon Gruden evidently believes the 26-year-old is his \"kicker of the future.\"\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Fantasy football's No. 2 kicker in 2020 is cashing in on a profoundly efficient season in which he made 36 of 39 field goal attempts, banging through all 36 of his extra point tries. He established himself as one of the league's big-footed kickers by nailing eight of nine kickers over 50 yards. Sanders' extension includes a $10 million guarantee. His 2020 numbers stand in stark contrast to his 2019 stats, which include seven missed field goals on 30 attempts. Only the Cowboys and Falcons attempted more field goals than Miami in 2020, giving Sanders the opportunity necessary to become a waiver wire darling in fantasy. Sanders will probably be one of the most over-drafted kickers in fantasy football next season.\u00a0\n",

There was some buzz in the first week of August that Blankenship's job was in real danger a year after he logged the fifth most field goals in the NFL. The Colts attempted the fourth most field goals in 2020 -- a key factor in Blankenship's fantasy usefulness. There's no reason to reach for Hot Rod in 2021 drafts, though you could do worse than the second-year kicker in the final round of redraft leagues.\u00a0\n",

The Bengals offense is among the league's most kicker friendly. Last season, Randy Bullock was fantasy's third highest scoring kicker when Joe Burrow went down with a season-ending knee injury. Fantasy managers should consider McPherson if the game's top kickers are off the draft board.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "As Over The Cap pointed out on Twitter, 29-year-old Santos has been cut five times since 2018. To say it's an aggressive move would be putting it mildly. The Bears were simply overjoyed by Santos' competent 2020 after years in the kicker wilderness. Santos converted 93.8 percent of his 2020 field goal tries, boosting his career mark to 83.1. Santos is not called on very often from 50-plus yards, making him an extra unlikely recipient of this kind of contract. There's a chance this deal could quickly become an albatross.\u00a0\n",

Okwara had the fifth most QB pressures among EDGE rushers last season, and was graded as Pro Football Focus' sixth best EDGE rusher through Week 3. His absence will make Detroit's defense even more toothless than it has been in the early going.\u00a0\n",
