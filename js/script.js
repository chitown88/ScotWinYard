Expect the Seahawks to continue passing at near league-high rates because the defense looks like they're playing with nine\u00a0players still.

Rivers' lone score in this one was a 13-yarder to Nyheim Hines who did the work to dive for the goal line before his knee was down. Rivers won't be a recommended fantasy play outside of two-QB superflex leagues next week against the Packers.\n",

    "analysis": "ESPN's Ed Werder said Brees is \"having his scans sent to other medical specialists for a second opinion to determine the full scope of his chest injuries.\" Depending on the second opinion, the team could place Brees on injured reserve, meaning he'd miss at least three games. If one were to read into this news, one might determine Brees got decidedly bad news about the recovery time for his serious injuries. Though Sean Payton has played coy about who would start at QB for the Saints with Brees sidelined, it'll probably be Jameis Winston. He could be an important fantasy pickup for the rest of the season.\u00a0\n",

Their rushing attack faced little resistance from Denver toward the end of the game so there was little need for Carr to drop back. He could have left the game with a touchdown but Darren Waller dropped a deep pass from Carr that would have been a walk-in touchdown. This is his third consecutive week under 200 yards. He faces the Chiefs next week so it's unlikely that his team will get to run on a massive lead to close out the game. Carr enters low-end QB2 territory in the more competitive matchup.\n",

The Eagles are painfully boring to watch with Wentz plummeting to career-low levels. Wentz continues to look for big plays that aren't there and misses easy gains with below-average accuracy. Hopefully things gel with more live reps with a healthy offense but that could be wishful thinking. Wentz will be a QB2 against the Browns in Week 11.\n",

Roethlisberger's deep ball still left a little bit to be desired, but it was crisper than it has been at times this year. He found Johnson for a beautiful 46-yard strike down the left sideline. Despite his seemingly diminished arm strength, Roethlisberger has been as decisive as ever this season. He's also wily, freeing Claypool for TD No. 1\u00a0with a pump fake to Eric Ebron. Week 11 opponent Jacksonville boasts one of the league's worst pass defenses before tougher matchups with Baltimore and Washington.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Trailing 30-26 with only a few seconds remaining, Murray was forced to his left but still found a way to square his shoulders while falling backwards and launch the game-winning Hail Murray 50 yards through the air and into the stone grasp of DeAndre Hopkins (7/127/1) between three defenders. With another two rushing touchdowns on Sunday, Murray inched just four\u00a0scores shy of matching Cam Newton (14, 2011)\u00a0for the single-season record at their respective position. Murray also became just the fourth quarterback in league history with a rushing touchdown in five consecutive games. The overall QB1 averaging the most fantasy points per game of any skill player through Week 10, Murray will again rank atop his position on Thursday night against Seattle. The Cardinals\u00a0walk into that one with sole possession of the NFC West.\n",

The Colts are one of the better defenses in football, and many expected a down week for Tannehill. He'll be more of a back-end QB1/2 next week against the Ravens.\n",

He was definitely lucky to have zero turnovers, not that he was making poor throws. Burrow did seem somewhat confused by the Steelers' coverages after the break.

The Lions' obliged with two and a half quarters of soft zone coverage that allowed Smith to rack up chunk plays. Before fantasy managers get excited about Smith as a streaming option, they should remember Smith is rarely -- if ever -- going to drop back and throw it 55 times. He'll be a solid superflex option in Week 11 against the Bengals' middling pass defense.\u00a0\n",

Goff wasn't a difference maker in the pocket, but he distributed the ball evenly to his weapons and consistently marched down the field. The yardage was nice, but all three of the touchdowns came on the ground. When everything is clicking, coach Sean McVay wants to lean on the run, limiting Goff's overall fantasy appeal. Things could get trickier if stud LT Andrew Whitworth (knee) is ruled out for the year. Goff facing the blitz-heavy Bucs on the road without his blindspot protector next week smells like trouble.

Jackson and veteran Jason McCourty on the outside. Flacco hit Breshad Perriman for a 50-yard touchdown over the top of Jackson in the second quarter, and then found Jamison Crowder behind McCourty for a perfectly-placed 20-yard toe-drag swag just before the half. Perriman later whooped Jackson again in the third quarter for a 15-yard score. But it was Flacco's fourth-quarter interception on the first play of one possession that gave the Patriots life to erase a 10-point deficit. The Jets ran just four plays in the fourth frame, going three-and-out on their other drive. Sam Darnold (shoulder) should be back after the bye to face the Chargers in Week 11.\n",

It seems the team is finally ready to embrace the rookie as their lead back after wasting a month pretending Peterson was the answer to their problems. Swift made something out of nothing on a few inside carries in the second half as the Lions milked the clock with a lead. His touchdown was a determined run after the catch that ended with Swift bulldozing a defender for the score. Fantasy players who stayed patient with Swift in September and October were rewarded handsomely in Week 10. The reward could continue for the rest of the season. He'll be a fringe RB1 in Week 11 against a terrible Panthers run defense.\u00a0\n",

He saved his day in PPR leagues with four receptions for an additional 16 yards. Despite Cook continuing to get stuffed for minimal games, Minnesota refused to try anything different. Even while averaging 3.2 yards per carry, Week 10 was Cook's fifth game over 100 total yards in his previous six outings. The only game that he didn't hit that mark saw him exit with an injury. Even in the games where Minnesota's offense looks ruined, Cook is likely to post a solid fantasy day. He remains a viable candidate to be the RB1 overall going forward.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Jacobs could have had a monstrous game but the Raiders had this game sealed away early and let Devontae Booker get in a solid revenge game versus his old team. Booker scored twice in the fourth quarter. Jacobs also added four catches for 28 yards on four targets. Jalen Richard left the game with a chest injury and Booker only saw one target. The loss of Richard could mean more work in the passing game for Jacobs but Booker may take on the role going forward. Jacobs remains one of the league's best backs between the tackles and his team is winning a majority of their games. Unfortunately for Jacobs, Las Vegas gets the Chiefs next week. They managed to pull off the upset the last time the two faced but that shouldn't be the expectation. Even if game-script doesn't go Jacobs' way, he should be able to push for 20 touches next week and remains an RB1.\n",

    "analysis": "Active for the first time since Week 4 after a lengthy stint on injured reserve with a knee issue, Chubb was held without a catch on one target. FOX color analyst Matt Millen kept talking up Kareem Hunt as the more decisive, quicker back today, but it was still Chubb who emerged victorious in awful weather conditions. Of course, Hunt did hold the rushing production advantage until the Browns' final non-kneeldown snap, where Chubb was free for a 60-yard touchdown ... until he went out of bounds at the one-yard line to ice the game and clock with 0:53 remaining. An absolutely brutal development for fantasy managers was a smart real life decision. The touchdown that Chubb did score was a nine-yarder where he cut back across the entire defense. As Millen fixated on, Chubb certainly appeared rusty, but he did seem healthy. With his sea legs back underneath him, he will remain a clear-cut, high-end RB1 for Week 11 against the Eagles.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "The day is even more impressive considering that Jones' lone reception, his first touch of the game, was fumbled away early in the first quarter. Bruce Arians displayed great trust in Jones after that, and was repaid by a 98-yard touchdown run, where Jones made S Tre Boston look foolish in the open field. Considering Jones combined for 23 carries over the course of the previous three games, this is a strong sign that the Bucs once again trust RoJo as their primary option out of the backfield. That would make him a top 15 option against the Rams in Week 11.\n",

Wednesday's final practice report should indicate just how healthy Carson is. If he gets his typical workload, Carson will be a borderline top-12 fantasy option in an ideal game environment against the up-tempo Cardinals. Alex Collins would draw another spot start if Carson and Carlos Hyde are unable to go. Hyde was a full participant Tuesday.\n",

    "headlineNews": "Jonathan Taylor rushed seven times for 12 yards in the Colts' Week 10 win over the Titans.\n",
    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Taylor seems to be setting new lows weekly at this point. After fumble-sixing against the Ravens last week, his seven carries were third on the Colts in a game they won convincingly by 17 points, and his 12 yards were a new season worst. Taylor was stuffed on a third-and-goal from the one-yard line in this one. He just runs too high at times, and that was particularly the case on that specific carry. Jordan Wilkins (8-28) wasn't much better in this one, but both were behind Nyheim Hines, who totaled 115 yards and recorded a season-best 12-70-1 rushing line. Taylor looks like the third man in this backfield committee. Frustrating as ever, Taylor is approaching drop status in 10- and 12-team leagues ahead of a Week 11 date with the Packers.\n",

The Steelers barely called Conner's number in the red zone, instead going pass heavy and at one point giving Chase Claypool a goal-line carry. Conner has been held under 50 yards rushing in three straight games, the latter two of which were A+ matchups. He is offering very little as a pass catcher. Circumstance keeps suggesting Conner will be an RB1, but it is not happening in practice. The Jaguars are yet another great spot for Week 11.\u00a0\n",

He exited early in the game with an apparent ankle injury but returned shortly after and didn't seem to be hampered by the injury. The good news for Gordon is that he only ceded six carries to Phillip Lindsay and Royce Freeman including the touches they racked up on his one missed drive. He needs his team to stay competitive to be a viable fantasy option and that may not be the case versus Miami next week. Gordon is a low-floor RB3 option moving forward.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Bernard actually got out-gained 55-47 by Samaje Perine, handling the rock just four more times than his journeyman backup. Nearly half of Perine's handles came deep into garbage time, but with game flow negative from the jump, Bernard never had a chance to stack up touches. He also did nothing to help the Bengals to sustain drives, with Joe Burrow and company turning in a horrid performance on third downs. The Bengals badly need Joe Mixon (foot) back, but he didn't seem all that close to playing this week. Bernard will remain the clear-cut starter if Mixon again sits for Week 11 vs. Washington, but he will be a touch-based RB2 instead of plug-and-play RB1.\u00a0\n",

Even as the Colts' pass-game specialist, Hines looked like the only Colts running back capable of converting a first down against Tennessee. While Taylor and Wilkins were blown up on several goal-line runs, it was Hines who punched in a two-yard touchdown in the third quarter after diving in for a 13-yard receiving score earlier in the night. Hines has three two-touchdown games to his name this season but zero scores in the other six\u00a0contests. Hines looks like the better of the three Colts' backs right now, but he's a low-floor RB3/FLEX most weeks but gets a plus date with the Packers in Week 11.\n",

For his touchdown, Johnson caught a 12-yard strike on a quick slant.\u00a0JuJu Smith-Schuster and Chase Claypool also reached 10-plus targets this afternoon, but that's a number Johnson has been an iron-clad lock for whenever he finishes a game healthy. He can be safely counted on for both a WR2 floor and ceiling on a weekly basis. Perhaps he will establish a WR1 ceiling down the stretch. The Jaguars are a cake Week 11 matchup.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

    "headlineNews": "Julio Jones caught 7-of-10 targets for 137 yards in the Falcons' Week 8 win over the Panthers.\u00a0\n",
    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Entering the proceedings with 16 catches 234 yards over his past two games, Jones stayed scorching, stacking up four receptions for 85 yards in the game's first 10 minutes. The bad news is, Matt Ryan failed to connect with his alpha wideout on not one, not two, but three end zone targets. The force field was back this evening. Jones' output was likely also affected by rain that really picked up after halftime. The big going forward takeaway was Calvin Ridley departing with an ankle injury. It did not have the looks of a season ender, but the Falcons head on bye after next week's date with the Broncos. Ridley is probably on the wrong side of questionable for Week 9. Jones will remain a locked-in top-three WR1.\u00a0\n",

Hill was a week winner on Sunday and could've been even more productive if not for a couple of rare misses from Patrick Mahomes.\u00a0With Sammy Watkins sidelined, Hill has seen more looks in recent weeks, and he remains one of the most efficient receivers in all of the NFL. Expect Hill to continue on his boom-bust WR1 trajectory following the Chiefs' Week 10\u00a0bye. He has all the ceiling in the world against the Raiders in two Sundays.\n",

For score No. 1, Claypool high-pointed an 11-yard pass at the goal line late in the third quarter. For No. 2, he ran a simple in route at the goal line, hauling in a five-yard strike to put the Steelers up 36-7 with 10:31 remaining. Up to a ridiculous nine scores in nine games, Claypool also received a carry from the Bengals' five-yard line in the second quarter, but he got knocked for a three-yard loss. Looking more and more uncoverable, Claypool has Ben Roethlisberger's undivided attention in the red zone. That keeps him locked in as a WR2 even in a crowded receiver corps where the targets can be a bit unpredictable week to week.\u00a0\n",

Despite that prodigious\u00a0volume, Smith-Schuster has still yet to have a 100-yard day, and is averaging less than 10 yards per catch. Diontae Johnson and Chase Claypool get all the deep work in this offense, with Johnson a targets hog and Claypool a red zone magnet. That conspires to keep Smith-Schuster as a low-end WR2.

Pittman's long gain of 40 yards was on a fourth-quarter catch-and-run. He also rushed one time for 21 yards. Pittman has seen 15 targets over the last two weeks and looks like someone who needs to be added in 12-team leagues for the stretch run.

    "analysis": "After seeing just three targets in Week 9, Moore was responsible for two massive plays in Week 10. The first was a rainbow vertical shot by Teddy Bridgewater against the blitz, which Moore worked back to and caught with defenders closing. Then Moore took a tunnel screen 24 yards for a touchdown, aided by an amazing kick-out block by LT Trent Scott. Moore nearly had another 40-yard gain to his name, but it was later reviewed and rescinded just before halftime. Moore's volume seems to be more scattered than Robby Anderson and Curtis Samuel each week, but he has big-play potential that is difficult to leave outside of the top 30 WRs.\n",

    "headlineNews": "Packers activated WR Allen Lazard (core) from injured reserve.\u00a0\n",
    "report": "",
    "analysis": "It initially looked like Lazard might return for Week 9 against the 49ers, but he ended up missing two more games, bringing his injured reserve stay to seven weeks. Lazard was running away with No. 2 duties behind Davante Adams before going down, but deep threat Marquez Valdes-Scantling has finally started to display signs of life in the past two weeks. TE Robert Tonyan also mixed in for some big days during Lazard's absence. No. 2 receiver nevertheless remains a position of need for the Packers, something they acknowledged with their deadline pursuit of Will Fuller. There is a path here for Lazard to catch 4-6 weekly passes. Provided he is actually active for Sunday's game against the Colts, he can be treated as a low-end WR4 in the WR40-48 range. There will then be the upside for more.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Cole also padded his fantasy stats with a 91-yard punt return for a touchdown \u2014 Jacksonville's first housed punt return since 2018 and the longest in franchise history. He had an ugly drop in the third quarter but bounced back with a 12-yard touchdown that (was a beautiful grab and) tied the game 17-17 in the second half. His seven targets, only one behind Chris Conley for the team lead, was also a\u00a0drastic increase from the two he saw in Jake Luton's debut. Unfortunately, Cole won't be usable outside of deeper leagues in Jacksonville's nightmarish matchup against the Steelers next week.\n",

Fantasy managers shouldn't expect this Ravens offense to support more than one fantasy relevant pass catcher though.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Meanwhile, Josh Reynolds ran 37 routes and Robert Woods ran 35 routes against Seattle. Reynolds paced the team with 10 targets. Kupp, who played just 53 percent of the team's offensive snaps, looked to be bothered by a wrist injury he sustained in Week 8 against Miami. Perhaps that explains his Week 10 usage. Either way, it's clear Reynolds is emerging as a weekly fantasy option for the Rams. Reynolds has a 22 percent target share over the team's past three games, second only to Kupp. He leads the team by a wide margin with 327\u00a0air yards in those three games.\u00a0\n",

Jerry Jeudy and KJ Hamler are emerging as weekly receiving threats on an offense that hasn't been able to consistently put points on the board. Fant can't be guaranteed eight targets every week and he plays on a weak offense. He remains a low-floor TE1 for now.\n",

    "analysis": "Witten spent 16 seasons with the Cowboys from 2003-2019. The most-recent version of the veteran TE wasn't all that great, as Witten set career-low marks in both yards per reception (8.4) and yards per target (6.4) in 2019. The fit with the Raiders is even more puzzling considering the presence of both Darren Waller and Foster Moreau. It's unlikely that Witten sees enough targets and snaps to work as a standalone fantasy option in 2020, but his presence undoubtedly lowers the ceiling of both Waller and Moreau.\n",
