It was one of his worst passing games of the year, however, with all four of his interceptions coming on ill-advised throws. This could have gone a lot worse, as Jackson got his touchdown and 39 of his yards on desperation throws to TE Mark Andrews. It's possible Jackson wasn't 100 percent after missing last week with a\u00a0non-COVID illness. Jackson will have a chance to rebound in a matchup with a Steelers secondary that could be without No. 1 CB Joe Haden in Week 13.\n",

Although the ankle issue will certainly limit his mobility, the Jets are 31st in yards per pass attempt allowed. Even if Hurts can't beat New York with his legs, he should be able to take advantage of their secondary. If he makes it through the week of practice with a clean bill of health, he'd slot in as a low-end QB1. Gardner Minshew would be a mid-QB2 option if Philly ultimately rests Hurts for the week.\n",

He's the first QB to throw a pick-six in three straight games since Matt Schaub did it in in four consecutive games in 2013. Stafford almost threw another pick-six in the fourth quarter with the Rams entering desperation mode. For fantasy purposes, Stafford got there on sheer volume alone, reminiscent of his Lions days. He had two highlight throws against a stiff Green Bay secondary: A 79-yard bomb to Van Jefferson in the first half and a 54-yard strike to Odell Beckham in the second half. His inconsistency and sustained struggles could cost the super-team Rams dearly in their championship run unless he gets healthier or corrects his devastating mistakes. Stafford and the Rams should dominate the Jaguars in Week 13.\u00a0\n",

Dallas' 14 penalties for 166 yards set a franchise record for most penalty yards in a game. Prescott was terrific otherwise, finding Cedrick Wilson for a 51-yard grab in the first half and Michael Gallup for catches of 41 and 32 yards in the fourth quarter before hitting Dalton Schultz for a 32-yard score to tie the game at 30 all. Prescott's lone mistake was a costly one, overthrowing Malik Turner on third down in overtime and forcing the team to punt. With Lamb and Cooper both expected back on Thursday night against New Orleans, Prescott will remain a confident QB1 in Week 13.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Graff suggested it's time for the team to \"let Cousins cook\" in an offense that should be more pass heavy without Dalvin Cook, its unquestioned offensive centerpiece. Head coach Mike Zimmer has long advocated for a balanced offense, and that's reflected in Vikings' rank of 23rd in pass frequency in neutral situations this year. \"That\u2019s right where Zimmer wants to be, an offense that throws half the time and runs half the time,\" Graff said. With one of the NFL's best receiver tandems and a serviceable No. 3 receiver in K.J. Osborn, Minnesota is certainly well positioned to thrive with a pass-heavy attack down the stretch. Through Week 12, they have one of the league's best passing offenses, ranking sixth in expected points added (EPA) per pass attempt. They have the third best EPA per drop back over the past five weeks. A ramped-up Minnesota passing attack would unlock a weekly fantasy ceiling for all involved. Alexander Mattison, based on rushing and pass catching volume alone, will be a top-12 fantasy option with Cook sidelined.\u00a0\n",

Wilson \"guided\" the offense to five straight three-and-outs at one point in this one, tying the longest three-and-out streak in the NFL this season. He had been stuck under 200 yards passing until the final drive, where Wilson hit a wide-open Freddie Swain for a 32-yard touchdown with 15 seconds left to play only for Wilson to get picked on the two-point conversion. In his three starts back, Wilson has averaged 205 passing yards with a combined 2:2 TD:INT mark. He didn't even target DK Metcalf until there were just over four minutes to play in the third quarter. And Metcalf didn't register his lone catch until there was 1:02 remaining. Wilson will be on short rest against the 49ers next week. At this point, he's impossible to start in season-long leagues.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Allen picked apart the Saints\u2019 defense with ease, finding Dawson Knox for a pair of scores that propelled the young tight end to a franchise record for receiving touchdowns in a season. He connected with Stefon Diggs and Matt Breida for his other two scores. Allen did have two blemishes on the day. Both of his interceptions were questionable throws and he now has at least one interception in four consecutive games. That is the longest streak of his career. Allen\u2019s 2021 campaign has been a bit more up-and-down than his 2020 season but he showed his ceiling as a passer and a fantasy option once again this week. Allen remains a strong QB1 option versus a surging New England squad next week.\n",

Mahomes was unlucky on the touchdown front: Travis Kelce inexplicably rushed for a touchdown from four yards out and Mahomes tossed to Clyde Edwards-Helaire for a two yard score in the first half. With Mahomes taking what defenses give him, his weekly ceiling isn't nearly what it was entering 2021. The Chiefs are on bye in Week 12.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Wentz completed 16-of-24 passes for 197 yards and all three of his touchdowns in the first half, building a 24-14 lead over the Bucs with a 62-yard drop into a bucket to Ashton Dulin, 15-yard strike on a wheel route to Jack Doyle, and a four-yard throw on 4th-and-1 while rolling out to his right to T.Y. Hilton. The tide turned in the third quarter for the Bucs as Shaq Barrett blindsided Wentz for a sack-fumble on Indianapolis' first drive out of the half, tracked Wentz's shot downfield to Michael Pittman for an interception during the ensuing possession, and capitalized later on a muffed punt from Nyheim Hines, turning those three turnovers into 17 points. Leonard Fournette scrambled in for a 28-yard score, his fourth of the day, to end the Colts' dreams of taking down the Super Bowl champs with only :20 remaining in regulation. 6-6 and still a full two games behind the 8-4 Titans for the AFC South lead, Indianapolis' upcoming rebound against the Texans is a crucial one in the AFC Wild Card picture.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Lance, the third pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, has one touch since Week 6 -- a three-yard rush against the Jaguars in Week 11. Shanahan said Lance's lack of playing time has nothing to do with his practice performance or preparation -- the team has a Lance-based package for every game -- but rather Shanahan's comfort as the team's offensive play caller.\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s been hard on me ... is when you do bring in a different quarterback who gets a different set of plays, it\u2019s almost the first play I\u2019ve been seeing of a new defense,\" Shanahan said, adding a QB rotation \"kind of hurts my rhythm a little bit.\" The 49ers offense has been humming of late, giving Shanahan little reason to force Lance into the lineup. Whether the team can avoid a quarterback rotation with Deebo Samuel (groin) sidelined remains to be seen. Lance should only be rostered as a stash in superflex leagues.\u00a0\n",

Still, it was another middling performance from the 36-year-old veteran. He was held under eight yards per pass attempt for the ninth time this year. That happened 10 times in 2020 and just six times in the prior year. With Julio Jones in Tennessee and Calvin Ridley away from the team, defenses only have to stop Kyle Pitts to limit Ryan and the Atlanta passing attack. The Jags took that approach this week and were successful, holding Pitts to just two catches. Ryan was also intercepted on one of his six throws to Pitts. With little chance of stringing together multiple explosive plays, Ryan can only be counted on for QB2 numbers in his Week 12 matchup with the Bucs.\n",

    "analysis": "Hill has been battling a bit of a foot issue and has played just 38 offensive snaps since his Week 5 concussion. With Trevor Siemian not getting the job done and the Saints fading in the playoff picture, coach Sean Payton decided it's the right time to get Hill under center. Hill will immediately become a streaming option for fantasy players. He brings huge upside as a runner. Hill's insertion isn't great news for New Orleans' pass-catchers, but Siemian wasn't really either. Look for the Saints to run the ball as much as possible with Hill, Mark Ingram, and possibly Alvin Kamara if active.\n",

Burrow was efficient through the air and picked on a couple backup cornerbacks facing off against Tee Higgins. For better or worse, it's clear the Bengals want to establish Mixon whenever they can. That could leave Burrow and Cincy pass catchers with reduced volume in games that feature plenty of neutral and positive game script. Burrow should be a fine QB2 option in Week 13 against the Chargers.\u00a0\n",

Missing a slew of weapons, Jacksonville's offense simply lacks the playmakers or elite quarterback necessary to move the ball. Lawrence's legs give him some QB2 life but his passing leaves a lot to be desired at this point. He can be left on waiver wires in all but 2QB leagues.\n",

    "analysis": "Coming off a trio of quieter affairs where the Pats were able to ratchet up their rushing attack against non-competitive opponents, Jones finally got some passing volume and turned it into a season-high 310 yards and his fifth multi-score start. Both of Jones' touchdowns went to Kendrick Bourne, with the first being an end zone dime over Kevin Byard and the second a 41-yarder where Bourne took a short target and turned it into a winding sideline affair. Jones was not perfect, missing what should have been a 26-yard touchdown to a free-and-clear Hunter Henry late in the first half, but he avoided turnovers against a severely-undermanned team. Although he is doing everything the Patriots could hope for in \"real life,\" Jones continues to provide a modest fantasy floor without much ceiling headed into a tough road date with the Bills.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Mixon would have easily had more than 200 rushing yards if the Bengals hadn't rested him in the fourth quarter, up 38 points on their division rival. The Bengals force fed Mixon on the team's opening drive and had no reason to stop against a Pittsburgh defense that's now given up 355 yards on the ground over their past two games. Mixon's four receptions on four targets was hopeful usage, even it resulted in negative yardage. With six scores over his past three games, Mixon has as much touchdown equity as any back in the game. The Bengals' game plan is clearly to feed Mixon whenever game script allows. He'll be a locked-and-loaded RB1 option in Week 13 against the Chargers -- one of the league's worst run defenses.\u00a0\n",

The focal point of the team's offense, Fournette will remain a strong RB1 in Week 13 against the Falcons.\n",

Drake notably didn't touch the ball until the 11:09 mark in the second quarter. With an increased role and at least four targets in every game without Henry Ruggs the past month, Jacobs will again be a touch-based RB2 against Washington in Week 13.\n",

    "analysis": "Gibson's carries and catches were both season-highs, besting his previous totals of 24 and three in the respective categories. He out-carried J.D. McKissic 29-7 and actually out-targeted the pass-game specialist 7-5, too. But it was McKissic who scored a pair of red-zone touchdowns with one each as a runner and receiver. Gibson was only missing the touchdown from his stat line, though he did punch in a two-point conversion in the third quarter. McKissic had to be carted off late with an apparent head/neck injury, leaving his status for Week 13 against Vegas up in the air. If McKissic needs to miss, Gibson's floor will be a bit safer as an RB2.\n",

Gaskin's two rushing scores were his second and third of the year. He has double-digit carries in six straight contests and will be a middling RB2 next week against the Giants.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Campbell added that the team would also use\u00a0Godwin Igwebuike and Jermar Jefferson. Igwebuike saw a carry and a target after D'Andre Swift went down with a shoulder issue in Week 12. Swift is not expected to play this week, elevating Williams to a considerable role.\u00a0Igwebuike will back him up but Campbell's comments paint Williams as a potential workhorse until Swift returns. Williams will step into high-end RB2 volume once Swift is officially ruled out. He turned 20 touches into 83 yards last week.\n",

Singletary should have a floor of double-digit carries whenever Moss is scratched but Breida remains the more explosive back and could see his role grow after another successful game.

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Cook reportedly suffered a dislocated shoulder and torn labrum in the Week 12 loss to the 49ers, but coach Mike Zimmer said that was false and labeled him \"day to day.\" Zimmer has never been entirely truthful regarding injuries in the past, however, so this report from Schefter is what we're going with for now. Alexander Mattison has touch counts of 36 and 36 in the two games Cook has missed this season and is the unquestioned top waiver pickup this week.\n",

It was Williams' first rushing score since Week 3 and long overdue. One of the most punishing runners this season, Williams paid off for fantasy players who fired him up in this easy on-paper matchup. Melvin Gordon still out-carried Williams 17-14 and remains the narrow 1A to Williams' 1B status. Williams gets a road date with the Chiefs in Week 13 as a back-end RB2.\n",

    "headlineNews": "Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said Ezekiel Elliott (knee) will have a \"serious load\" on Thursday night against New Orleans.\u00a0\n",
    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Elliott's most ardent backer, Jones dismissed questions about easing Zeke's workload while he's hampered by bone bruise on his knee. ESPN's Ed Werder reported last week that the team had considered giving Elliott \"time off to heal\" and get ready for a postseason run, and NFL Network's Ian Rapoport said the Cowboys could \"alter\" Zeke's usage. Not so, says Jerry. An ineffective and slow Elliott rushed for 25 yards and a short touchdown on nine carries in Dallas' Thanksgiving loss to Vegas. Tony Pollard, meanwhile, continues to rip off explosive plays and appears to be the Cowboys' best running back option. Unfortunately for Pollard drafters, that doesn't matter. Pollard won't be much more than a flex option in 12-team leagues as long as the Cowboys are committed to Elliott as the rapidly declining centerpiece of their offense.\u00a0\n",

Bolden's PPR appeal is stifled by the surging Patriots generating ample positive game script that limits Mac Jones' drop backs. Bolden should be rostered in 14-team leagues though.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Kupp's touchdown cold streak extends to three games, though his PPR production remains stable thanks to consistent volume in the pass-heavy LA offense. Kupp tied for the team lead with ten looks from Matthew Stafford, and despite not catching a pass in the first quarter, approached 100 yards. Much of his production came in hurry-up mode. Kupp nearly connected with Van Jefferson on a long touchdown in the first half. Kupp's throw led Jefferson too close to the sideline and the touchdown was taken off the board when replay showed Jefferson's toe out of bounds. Kupp will again be fantasy's WR1 in Week 13 against a bad Jacksonville secondary.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Renfrow led the team in targets, catches, and receiving yards, recording four of his eight catches from the slot for 105 yards. Usually deployed as a possession receiver close to the line of scrimmage or at the sticks, Renfrow's 54-yard reception in the third quarter was actually the second-longest reception by air yards (41) of his career, tacking on a 31-yard catch earlier in the game, too. His floor-ceiling combo should be viewed even higher in Week 13 if Darren Waller (knee) can't go.\n",

    "headlineNews": "Stefon Diggs caught 7-of-9 targets for 74 yards and a touchdown in the Saints' Week 12 win over the Bills.\n",
    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Diggs has seen his target share dip this year but that wasn't the case versus New Orleans. His nine targets accounted for 31 percent of Josh Allen's attempts. He led the Bills in all receiving categories but touchdowns as Dawson Knox found the end zone twice. Diggs scored his seventh touchdown of the year with an immaculate display of footwork that shook Marshon Lattimore off him at the goal line. He gets a difficult matchup with the Patriots next week but fantasy managers can continue relying on him for WR1 numbers in Week 13.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "It was once again Hill the stat compiler in Week 11. He wasn't targeted deep with the Cowboys playing two deep safeties, copying the formula that has stymied the Kansas City offense for the past six weeks. Hill can still get there for fantasy purposes with the Chiefs' dink-and-dunk approach; his days of nuclear fantasy games might be behind him though. Hill is almost guaranteed double digit targets every week in the team's highly-concentrated passing attack. He'll be a high-end WR1 play in Week 13 against Denver, following the Chiefs' Week 12 bye.\u00a0\n",

Pittman's 10 targets (22.7%) were still a team-high mark and the fourth time he's seen double-digit targets this year. He'll return in Week 13 as a volume-based WR2/3 against Houston.\n",

It is abundantly clear the 24-year-old is now Chicago's top weapon and should continue to be treated as such upon Robinson's return. Mooney's longest grab this afternoon was a 52-yarder where he ran right by S Will Harris. Even if Robinson returns for Week 13 vs. the Cardinals, Mooney has earned every-week WR2 treatment until further notice, though Andy Dalton keeping the job over Justin Fields (ribs) would probably help.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

    "headlineNews": "NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reports Deebo Samuel (groin) is expected to \"miss a little time.\"\n",
    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Samuel, who will undergo further testing on the groin injury that kept him sidelined during the second half of the 49ers' Week 12 win against the Vikings, avoided \"a major injury,\" according to Rapoport. The Niners will be as careful as possible with the unstoppable centerpiece of their offense; Samuel drafters should be prepared to be without their stud offensive weapon for at least Week 13. Samuel's absence wouldn't create a target vacuum as much as it will open up carries for Elijah Mitchell and the team's running backs. Samuel has logged 20 rushing attempts over the past three games, including six for 66 yards and two touchdowns against Minnesota's shoddy run defense. A fully healthy Deebo -- who has a history of soft tissue injuries -- for the fantasy playoffs would give Deebo drafters a massive boost in their championship pursuit.\u00a0\n",

It was his first 100-yard effort of the season and only the third time eclipsing 70 receiving yards. Joe Burrow repeatedly took advantage of single coverage on Higgins by backup Steelers corners filling in for the injured Joe Haden. Higgins coming into Week 12 had a 23 percent target share and a 34 percent air yards share over the team's past five games, trailing JaMarr Chase narrowly in each category. Higgins should be able to provide low-end WR2 production in an efficient Cincy offense even if the Bengals remain committed to establishing the run, as they did in their blowout win over the Steelers. Higgins can be considered a high-end WR3 next week against the Chargers.\u00a0\n",

His score was a 39-yarder where he used a double move to burn the secondary. Making his first start with his former Rams quarterback Jared Goff, Reynolds certainly seemed to have chemistry with his signal caller, a rarity in Detroit this season. Despite today's nice statline, Reynolds will be a tough sell as a WR5 for Week 12 against the Vikings.\u00a0\n",

Struggling with a persistent cough, Cooper did not practice Monday and might not practice Tuesday, per McCarthy. Why he's back in the team facility while symptomatic is an entirely different issue. It's not quite the optimistic picture Jerry Jones painted Tuesday morning when asked about Cooper's availability for the team's Thursday night game against the Saints. Cooper's continued absence would make Michael Gallup a low-end WR2 option in Week 13.\u00a0\n",

Targeted on over 32.2% of Tua Tagovailoa's throws in this one, Waddle has been the engine of the Miami passing attack all year with DeVante Parker and Will Fuller in the midst of lost, injury-riddled seasons. Waddle has seen at least six targets in all but one game since Week 1 and will be a volume-driven WR2 next week against the Giants.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Seventy-nine of Jefferson's 93 yards came on a deep shot from Matthew Stafford in the first half. Jefferson hauled in the rainbow ball and broke away from a Packers defender for the walk-in score. Jefferson left a lot of production on the field though: He stepped out of bounds on a would-be touchdown pass from Cooper Kupp in the first half and he dropped an easy 15-yard pass in the fourth quarter that would have put him over 100 yards on the day. Running as a starter with Robert Woods (ACL) done for the season, Jefferson should be a weekly high-end WR3, at worst. The underperforming LA defense creating ample negative game script has been excellent for Jefferson and the team's other pass catchers. He consistently enjoyed single coverage against the Packers while Green Bay's secondary focused on stopping Cooper Kupp. Jefferson, like every fantasy relevant Ram, will be an intriguing option next week against Jacksonville.\u00a0\n",

The NFL's punishment for a first DUI is a three-game suspension without pay. The Saints and Harris knew the suspension would come down later in the season, according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport. Harris' appeal could give him enough time to play in Week 13 against the Cowboys before missing three of the season's final five games.\u00a0\n",

His next most notable play was being the target on one of Jalen Hurts' three incerecptions. Watkins has impressed at times this season and has earned a bigger role in the Eagles' offense. But he will be a weak FLEX option in Week 13, even with the Eagles taking on the Jets.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Jags coach Urban Meyer talked about getting Shenault more involved in the offense earlier in the week with Jamal Agnew on injured reserve. Agnew is done for the year due to a hip issue. However, this was a less than ideal way for Shenault to lead his team in targets. He was mainly used on throws near or behind the line of scrimmage once again. This led him to earn 3.7 yards per target against a weak Atlanta defense. His usage looked more like that of a pass-catching running back than a wide receiver, as it has throughout the year. Shenault can be kept out of fantasy lineups until he shows the ability to do more than catch a few short passes each week.\n",

Matt Ryan was even intercepted while trying to force a pass to Pitts in the first half. With Calvin Ridley away from the team, this approach has been the go-to for opposing defenses. Expect it to continue for the foreseeable future with no update on Ridley from himself of the team. Pitts plays an immense role for a tight end but every team he faces knows that, making it difficult for him to get open on any play. He remains a TE1 going forward but his floor is undoubtedly lower with no Atlanta player beyond Cordarrelle Patterson drawing the respect of defenses.\n",

    "analysis": "McKeon (6'3/242) made 23 starts across 40 appearances for the Wolverines, missing three games in 2019 with a leg injury. He's typically used his good route running to create separation but lacks the strength to consistently win 50-50 balls through contact. McKeon's receiving production also inexplicably dipped in his final three years at Michigan as he hauled in 31 < 14 < 13 catches from 2017 on. NFL scouts still attest that he's a coachable and reliable teammate, and coach Jim Harbaugh routinely praised McKeon for his fundamental blocking. There are enough skills in the 22-year-old's toolbox to see him stashed on a practice squad while his unimpressive body and build develop.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Kelce scored his touchdown on an Andy Reid galaxy brain red zone play call in which the tight end received a direct snap -- with Patrick Mahomes line up behind him -- and plunged into the middle of the line. He had his weekly dropped pass and weekly sideline helmet slam, along with another elongated stare at the hands that betrayed him. Kelce was a beneficiary of the Cowboys forcing Mahomes to dink and dunk underneath the entire game. He'll continue as the unquestioned No. 1 fantasy tight end in Week 13 against the Broncos, following the Chiefs' Week 12 bye. Fantasy managers hope Kelce -- who has one receiving score over his past six outings -- can snap out of his touchdown cold streak.\u00a0\n",

His second most notable play was when he nearly caused an interception by letting a ball bounce off his hands, but the Eagles' defender was out of bounds. Engram has close to an every-down role, but he's still only relevant for fantasy as a TE dart throw. He will remain a way option when the Giants take on the Dolphins in Week 13.\n",

The two had no issues carving up DC Matt Eberflus' zone scheme over the middle of the field, recording long gains of 26 and 15 yards for Gronkowski along the way. He was also targeted at the goal line in the fourth quarter but was hit hard while trying to corral the ball. A full-time player with a 23.3% target share since returning from injury in Week 11, Gronkowski remains a matchup-proof top-three TE in any game he's active for.\n",

His breakout season has been slow in recent weeks with this 3-17 day and a zero-ball two weeks ago sandwiched around a 5-50 effort. Gesicki will try to rebound next week against the Giants.\n",

He managed a meager five targets on a day that saw Matthew Stafford throw 38 passes. Higbee, like most tight ends in fantasy, is a touchdown-or-bust option. He's been held to less than 40 yards in four of his past six games. He'll be a streaming play in Week 13 against the Jaguars.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "McPherson, the 149th pick in the 2021 draft, drilled a 50-yarder against Washington in Friday's preseason game -- a kick that would have been good from at least 60 yards. McPherson is the favorite in the team's kicker competition with veteran Austin Seibert, who has also impressed coaches and beat writers this month. The Bengals offense is among the league's most kicker friendly. Last season, Randy Bullock was fantasy's third highest scoring kicker when Joe Burrow went down with a season-ending knee injury. Fantasy managers should consider McPherson if the game's top kickers are off the draft board.\u00a0\n",

Carlson converted 94.3 percent of his 2020 field goal attempts after he was a far worse 73.1 percent in 2019. Carlson was 4-of-4 beyond 50 yards last season as he quietly finished as fantasy's fourth highest scoring kicker thanks largely to the NFL's seventh most attempts. He'll likely be overdrafted in seasonal leagues this season. Coach Jon Gruden evidently believes the 26-year-old is his \"kicker of the future.\"\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Patterson (5\u201910/181) was a three-star prospect that was rated as the 16th best kicker from the 2017 prep class. The Edwardsville, IL native struggled a bit as a freshman, converting 69 percent of his field goals while registering only two touchbacks on 24 kickoffs. However, Patterson showed consistent year-over-year improvement throughout his career, boosting his conversion rate to 75 percent in 2018 and 92 percent in 2019. In addition to his on-point accuracy, Patterson converted five-of-six attempts of 50 or more yards two seasons ago. His production slipped a bit in 2020, making 15-of-22 attempts, but five of those misses came from beyond the 50-yard threshold, so that should be accounted for. Though he doesn\u2019t possess the most imposing leg in the class, his touchback rate was decent, as 38-of-63 kickoffs were not returned. He will need to iron out his conversion rate if he is going to stick around at the NFL level. The Vikings only have one other kicker rostered, third-year boot Greg Joseph, who has just 20 career field goal attempts. Expect a true kicking completion to take place between Joseph and Patterson if the Vikings don't bring in anyone else.\n",

The Bears were simply overjoyed by Santos' competent 2020 after years in the kicker wilderness. Santos converted 93.8 percent of his 2020 field goal tries, boosting his career mark to 83.1. Santos is not called on very often from 50-plus yards, making him an extra unlikely recipient of this kind of contract. There's a chance this deal could quickly become an albatross.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Fantasy football's No. 2 kicker in 2020 is cashing in on a profoundly efficient season in which he made 36 of 39 field goal attempts, banging through all 36 of his extra point tries. He established himself as one of the league's big-footed kickers by nailing eight of nine kickers over 50 yards. Sanders' extension includes a $10 million guarantee. His 2020 numbers stand in stark contrast to his 2019 stats, which include seven missed field goals on 30 attempts. Only the Cowboys and Falcons attempted more field goals than Miami in 2020, giving Sanders the opportunity necessary to become a waiver wire darling in fantasy. Sanders will probably be one of the most over-drafted kickers in fantasy football next season.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "The Jaguars had little choice but to cut ties with their kicker of five seasons. Lambo had whiffed on all three of his field goal attempts and two extra points this season. He was inactive in Week 5 against the Dolphins and backup kicker Matthew Wright drilled all three of his field goal tries, including a game-winning kick that temporarily relieved Urban Meyer's suffering. Lambo was once among the league's most accurate kickers, making 71 of his 75 field goal tries (94.6 percent) from 2017 to 2019. Wright shouldn't be considered a reliable fantasy option on a Jacksonville team that generates almost no positive game script. Lambo, meanwhile, has a good shot of landing on another team as a fill-in kicker.\u00a0\n",

The No. 5 overall pick of the 2018 draft, Chubb is signed through next season after the Broncos exercised his fifth-year team option.\u00a0\n",
