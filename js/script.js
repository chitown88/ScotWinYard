One of his four TD tosses was caught by rookie Tylan Wallace, who could have a role in Baltimore's offense if the team's starting wideouts don't heal up by opening day. Baltimore doesn't have to shift its offense for Huntley if he's forced to play this season -- he's a dual-threat QB who can beat defenses with his legs as well as a strong arm. Huntley should be rostered in superflex leagues in case Lamar Jackson misses more time with COVID-19.\u00a0\n",

We've got be better in all aspects of the game.\" Murray is correct that the Cardinals' offense went into a tailspin following his injury issues. It is more debatable if his legs can become a luxury. They might have to remain a necessity considering the way they unlocked Kliff Kingsbury's attack last season. Fantasy managers shouldn't worry about it too much. Especially as he remains in his early 20s, Murray essentially has no choice but to keep running as he hunts for big plays and tries to keep defenses off-balance.\u00a0\n",

As of early April, Fontenot and head coach Arthur Smith were reportedly split on using the No. 4 pick on North Dakota State QB Trey Lance. What Atlanta does with its first round pick with have reverberations across the league. But if they pass on a high-end quarterback prospect with the fourth pick, the Falcons could select a signal caller in the second or third round -- someone who could sit behind Matt Ryan for a year or two before taking over the offense. A QB like Kyle Trask or Davis Mills could end up on Atlanta's roster as Ryan's 2021 backup. Trask in 2020 was first in the nation with 43 touchdown passes and second in passing yards, behind Mac Jones.\u00a0\n",

RB Jeremy McNichols, who could be the team's No. 2 back while Darrynton Evans (knee) is on IR,\u00a0was also taken off the COVID list on Saturday. After reluctantly getting the COVID-19 vaccine, Tannehill was removed from the COVID list after testing negative for the virus twice. ESPN's Adam Schefter said Tannehill is \"on track\" to start Week 1 against the Cardinals, whose inexperienced secondary makes Tannehill a top opening week fantasy option. The Titans-Cardinals game sports the week's second highest over-under (51.5).\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "We take \"top quarterbacks\" to mean Justin Fields, Trey Lance, and Mac Jones, since Trevor Lawrence and Zach Wilson are spoken for. Rapoport said if one of the top QBs slides beyond the tenth pick, the Raiders could pounce. There's no universe in which Fields, Lance, or Jones fall to the Raiders at No. 17; Vegas will have to trade up to nab one of the signal callers if they drop out of the top ten. While Rapoport described the potential Raiders QB being a \"stash for the future,\" any of Lance, Fields, or Jones would immediately compete for the team's Week 1 starting job.\u00a0\n",

He frequently looked to throw past the sticks and even hit Diontae Johnson on a 43-yard strike. Both of Roethlisberger\u2019s scores went to rookie tight end Pat Freiermouth. Detroit will field one of the weakest secondaries this year, so it\u2019s dangerous to take away too much from this game. However, an increased emphasis on downfield throws would drastically change the complexion of Pittsburgh's passing attack. This performance should at least give fantasy managers the confidence they need to draft Steelers receivers at their current salaries. \n",

Left tackle Andrew Thomas was a revolving door, allowing anyone who wanted to pressure Jones to do so, but Jones also held onto the ball too long at times. He also gifted the Patriots an interception while on their one-yard line. Jones saved an otherwise dreadful night with an impressive two-minute drill to close out the first half. He marched the New York offense down the field before delivering a perfectly-placed deep shot to tight end Kaden Smith for a touchdown. This type of erratic performance should be the norm for Jones in 2021. He\u2019s capable of making incredible throws but will do so after a handful of crippling mistakes. Jones will be a frustrating player to decipher for fantasy managers but will manage to post QB2 numbers through his rushing production.\n",

While it's difficult to take much away from a pair of preseason drives, this could point toward Kevin Stefanski letting Mayfield throw a bit more in his fourth season as a pro. If the reports of the Browns loosening the reigns on their franchise quarterback are true, Mayfield could be in for a breakout campaign. He finished 13th in touchdown rate and adjusted yards per attempt last year but lacked the volume to make a major fantasy impact. If he takes another step forward as a thrower and Cleveland inches toward league-average in passing volume, Mayfield will easily pay off his low-end QB2 ADP.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

His third and final drive of the day resulted in a well-timed throw to Laviska Shenault for another score. It was nearly a flawless game for the rookie and his performance should give fantasy drafters the confidence to take him as a high-end QB2. \n",

Newton was a surprising release on Tuesday morning, locking in Jones as starter and Brian Hoyer as the No. 2. The Patriots' projected offense will look much different under Jones \u2014 we are not going to be seeing any QB keepers in the red zone \u2014 but this will remain a run-heavy attack. It will also now have a quarterback capable of involving the Patriots' army of new arrivals, from Nelson Agholor and Kendrick Bourne to Hunter Henry and Jonnu Smith. Jakobi Meyers projects as Jones' top early-season target. Even if Damien Harris and the running game form the early-year backbone of the offense, Jones is worth a pick in all superflex leagues, and will be streamable in re-draft.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Bridgewater's first test upon being anointed Denver's starting quarterback got off to a rocky beginning, going 1-for-6 for four yards during the team's first two drives of its preseason finale. Bridgewater fortunately picked up the slack for Denver's third possession, going 5-of-5 for 58 yards and an\u00a0eight-yard touchdown strike to Courtland Sutton to cap off his night. The 28-year-old veteran isn't an exciting selection, but he undoubtedly has value in SuperFlex leagues given the Broncos' projected schedule against the league's easiest slate of opposing\u00a0pass defenses. There's no need to roster him beyond that format.\n",

Winston taking the Saints' starting gig will allow Hill to \"fill his valuable gadget/do-everything role,\" per NFL Network's Ian Rapoport. That, of course, could be an issue for Winston's touchdown upside if head coach Sean Payton deploys Hill near the goal line. Winston, 27, becomes one of the best late-round QB selections in superflex formats. His presence under center is a boon for every pass catcher in the New Orleans offense. He'll bring far more aggressive downfield passing than we saw with Drew Brees at the helm of Payton's offense. The Saints last year threw 29 passes that traveled 20-plus yards beyond the line of scrimmage -- fewer than any team since the 2014 season. Winston can earn up to $7 million this season in incentives, mostly based on statistical markers.\u00a0\n",

    "headlineNews": "Jets head coach Robert Saleh said QB Zach Wilson is \"light years ahead of normal rookies\" in his study habits and preparation.\u00a0\n",
    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Saleh and the New York coaching staff have done little but gush about the No. 2 overall pick in the 2021 draft since the beginning of August. Wilson shredded Green Bay's second-team defense last week, completing nine of 11 passes for 128 yards and two scores. Though he hasn't displayed his rushing prowess this preseason, Wilson -- who rushed for 255 yards last year at BYU -- can and will produce on the ground in the NFL. ESPN's Rich Cimini said \"you couldn't ask for a smoother transition\" than the one Wilson has had this spring and summer. Wilson will likely be a solid streaming option in 12-team leagues this season.\u00a0\n",

While Derrick Henry is set for another monster workload as the Titans' early down back, Evans could squeeze some fantasy value out of a pass-catching role in a Tennessee offense that could be slightly less run heavy than we've seen in recent seasons. Evans is a sensible late-round pick for drafters seeking running back lottery tickets.\u00a0\n",

It is the worst possible news after Etienne went down in Monday evening's smackdown preseason loss to the Saints. It further clouds Etienne's future upside after the Jags spent the summer treating him like a pure pass-catching back, though Etienne is still five months shy of his 23rd birthday. He is obviously a strong hold in Dynasty leagues, one certainly worthy of \"buy low\" offers. As for 2021 re-draft, James Robinson is now the favorite for passing-down snaps in addition to early downs, though Carlos Hyde's between-the-tackles hand is strengthened, too. Laviska Shenault is probably also due a targets boost in projections, as well.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "ESP notes that through seven training camp practices, Sanders has narrowly out-touched Scott just 35-29 with the first-team offense. With Jalen Hurts under center, expect the Eagles to implement a run-centric offense, so Sanders should get a good number of carries, but it truly sounds like Scott is going to be heavily involved as the preferred pass-catcher and change-of-pace back. Sanders has dealt with injuries and can't be trusted for a full workload. Sanders is currently being drafted as a back-end RB2 while Scott isn't even being drafted in 12-team fantasy leagues. Rookie Kenneth Gainwell looks like the clear No. 3.\n",

Malcolm Brown out-snapped Gaskin 16-7 with Miami's starters during the first preseason game but it was the latter who came roaring back with 19 snaps to Brown's five in the following contest.

    "analysis": "Dugar noted that Dallas looked\u00a0like the best route-runner from Seattle's backfield but still needs to work on his pass-blocking to secure the role. That would be a major blow to Rashaad Penny, who is also in play as an option on third-downs. Penny was a serviceable pass-catcher in college but has been unable to get on the field in any capacity since joining the league. He has appeared in 27 games over three years and has yet to make his first official start. Chris Carson is also in the mix for receiving duties. He looked comfortable when asked to catch passes last year, tying his career-high in receptions (37) in just 12 games. Dallas won't be a viable fantasy option even if he does secure the role but that would remove Penny from draft boards and take some upside off the table for Carson.\n",

His Sunday and Monday practice status will loom large for his Week 1 availability as the Bucs kick off the NFL season against Dallas on Thursday Night Football. Bernard is locked into the passing down role and could become a favorite target for Tom Brady this year after Ronald Jones and Leonard Fournette were abysmal as pass catchers in 2020. Fournette is more likely than stone-hands Jones to take on pass-catching duties if Bernard is sidelined in Week 1.\u00a0\n",

Chubb also led the league\u00a0in NFL Next Gen's rush yards over expected per attempt, demonstrating an elite ability to consistently succeed on his attempts. Literally the only weakness in Chubb's game is his receiving ability. His career yards per route run is just 1.04 and last year's RB27 finish was his career high.

Gordon, who missed OTAs and some of training camp, rushed five times for 35 yards and caught a four-yard pass against LA. The rookie looks poised to split backfield work with Gordon when the Broncos kick off the season against the Giants.

He topped five carries in a game just once, running for 124 yards on 21 totes in Week 16 versus the Titans. Still, the added confidence from his coaching staff is a good sign. Both Sirmans and Aaron Jones have noted that Dillon knows the offense much better entering his second year. Dillon's experiencing catching passes is almost nonexistent so any role increase will come in the form of extra work on early downs. Because of his limited skill set, Dillon projects as an RB4 with breakout potential if he manages to\u00a0steal away more work than expected from Jones.\n",

It was the second week in a row where the Bills divvied up their first-team snaps with Singletary ahead of Moss. Confusing matters further, though, is that the Bills attempted zero rushes during Singletary's quarter. We would assume the duo's full-blown committee is here to stay, with Singletary the preferred option on passing downs and Moss getting the early-down advantage when Josh Allen isn't calling his own number. That will be a hard way for Moss to make a FLEX living.\u00a0\n",

His ninth round ADP in 12-team leagues means fantasy managers are bullish on his prospects as a timeshare back who could see goal line work in Arizona's offense.\u00a0\n",

Patterson, a preseason stud for Washington,\u00a0should be rostered in all deep league formats. Other teams will surely be interested in signing Barber before the regular season starts.\u00a0\n",

It's possible that Henderson was going to form a committee with another running back all along, with that running back now revealed to be\u00a0Michel. McVay's comments are still a positive sign, in the sense that Henderson only needs to maintain a large share of receiving work and to mix in and the goal line to retain significant fantasy value. As long as the Rams don't view Michel as the clear-cut starter, the explosive Henderson can still be viewed as a viable upside play in fantasy drafts.\n",

It's still notable that\u00a0McFarland, who was expected to operate as the Steelers' No. 2 running back, could miss a chunk of the season. That would leave Benny Snell and Kalen Ballage as Pittsburgh's backup running back options. With that in mind, it won't be a surprise if\u00a0Najee Harris handles 80% or more of the Steelers' snaps for as long as\u00a0McFarland is out of the lineup.\n",

With a win total of just four games, the lowest in the league, this plan of attack seems destined for a head-on collision with reality.

    "analysis": "Coleman's familiarity with the team's new offense proved insurmountable for Ty Johnson and rookie Michael Carter, leaving Coleman as the default RB1 headed into New York's Week 1 matchup against Carolina. ESPN's Rich Cimini said in June that Coleman has the most straightaway speed\" of any New York back, appearing to be \"shot out of cannon\" once he's made his cut in the famed Shanahan rushing attack. No one's idea of an exciting fantasy option, Coleman should be considered in some deeper fantasy formats against the Panthers. Ty Johnson would likely be next in the pecking order if Carter's concerning preseason usage is any indication. NBC Sports Edge's John Daigle recommended Johnson and Coleman as waiver wire adds this week.\u00a0\n",

Zack Moss then got the entire second quarter with the Bills' starters, playing 16-of-18 snaps and rushing four times for 10 yards. It is the same thing the Bills did in Week 2 of the preseason. Singletary clearly has the passing-game advantage. It is more muddled between the tackles. In the red zone, Josh Allen will probably be option one for \"goal-line carries.\" Singletary is a \"better value\" in fantasy drafts, but it is hard to see either Singletary or Moss being a viable FLEX option on a weekly basis.\u00a0\n",

Instead they're likely to\u00a0repeatedly run the ball whenever they have the chance. With a win total of just four games, the lowest in the league, this plan of attack seems destined for a head-on collision with reality. Nevertheless, the Houston's\u00a0offensive philosophy is likely to yield slower paced games that are far less fantasy friendly for opposing teams than in years past. The Texans host the Jaguars in Week 1.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Hines, according to beat writers and coaches, enters the regular season following the best training camp of his four-year career. The pass-catching specialist has been vocal about his desire to see more action in 2021. Keefer said the consensus among Indianapolis coaches this offseason was that they didn't give Hines enough snaps or touches in 2020, but that it would be difficult to increase his usage with Jonathan Taylor locked into the lead back role. Hines has\u00a0never seen more than 44 percent of the Colts\u2019 offensive snaps; he was on the field for 36 percent of the team's offensive snaps last year. He excelled when given the chance: Against the Titans in Week 11, he turned 17 touches into 155 yards and two scores with Taylor sidelined. Hines is a solid tenth round pick in 12-team PPR formats for drafters who fade early-down running backs.\u00a0\n",

With a win total of just four games, the lowest in the league, this plan of attack seems destined for a head-on collision with reality.

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Carolina waived RB Rodney Smith and released RB\u00a0Reggie Bonnafon to get to 53, leaving Hubbard as the clear-cut No. 2 back behind Christian McCaffrey. An All-American as a sophomore at Oklahoma State --\u00a0rushing for 2,084 yards and 21 touchdowns -- Hubbard carved out the backup role with a strong preseason in which he rushed for 139 yards on 26 carries. Hubbard displayed the burst and big-play ability he showed at Oklahoma State. He should be rostered in every 12-team league as a potential top-12 back should CMC once again struggle with injuries in 2021. The Athletic's Joe Person said there's almost no scenario where Hubbard would split backfield work with McCaffrey.\u00a0Carolina \"didn\u2019t make McCaffrey the highest-paid running back in league history to have him alternate series with Chuba Hubbard or Spencer Brown,\" he said.\u00a0\"He\u2019s going to be on the field for nearly every offensive snap when the score\u2019s close, and probably when it\u2019s not.\"\n",

It is the worst possible news after Etienne went down in Monday evening's smackdown preseason loss to the Saints. It further clouds Etienne's future upside after the Jags spent the summer treating him like a pure pass-catching back, though Etienne is still five months shy of his 23rd birthday. He is obviously a strong hold in Dynasty leagues, one certainly worthy of \"buy low\" offers. As for 2021 re-draft, James Robinson is now the favorite for passing-down snaps in addition to early downs, though Carlos Hyde's between-the-tackles hand is strengthened, too. Laviska Shenault is probably also due a targets boost in projections, as well.\u00a0\n",

He'll now be out for the first three games of the season at a minimum. The move leaves Benny Snell and Kalen Ballage as the on-roster backups to rookie runner Najee Harris, who is in line for a massive role in his rookie season. McFarland was the only backup to see a meaningful amount of reps with the starter in the preseason and could have earned some work on third downs. Neither Snell nor Ballage has the pass-catching chops that McFarland does. His absence gives Harris a small boost in receiving production and keeps him locked in as a low-end RB1.\n",

Gibson's usage in the Football Team's first preseason game wasn't exactly inspiring though. The second-year back started the game and saw no third-down snaps against the Patriots. Gibson was, however, targeted thrice in limited playing time. He won't require a massive increase in targets or receptions to prove a value in 2021, a year after catching 36 of 44 targets in 14 games (a pace of 50 targets in 16 games). Gibson enters 2021 with as much potential as any second-round RB to blow away his ADP.\u00a0\n",

Edwards-Helaire had three carries for 13 yards and one catch for ten yards with KC's first-team offense before exiting with the ankle issue. If the injury lingers and CEH were to miss any regular season time, Darrel\u00a0Williams and Jerick McKinnon would likely split work in the\u00a0KC backfield. Since neither McKinnon nor Williams profiles as an early-down back, Darwin Thompson or Elijah McGuire could be in line for some sort of workload if Edwards-Helaire can't get right before Week 1. We could see Edwards-Helaire's ADP slip with this injury news.\u00a0\n",

Swift could be a sneaky mid-range RB2 option in PPR formats against the Niners.\u00a0\n",

Malcolm Brown, who started the Dolphins' preseason opener, only earned five snaps with the first team. There's simply no clarity to the pecking order in this backfield. For now, Gaskin appears to be the leader of a rushing committee while also\u00a0having\u00a0a stronghold on the receiving work. Ahmed and Brown will be in contention for backup duties leading into Week 1 if Gaskin holds onto that role.\n",

He'll now be out for the first three games of the season at a minimum. The move leaves Benny Snell and Kalen Ballage as the on-roster backups to rookie runner Najee Harris, who is in line for a massive role in his rookie season. McFarland was the only backup to see a meaningful amount of reps with the starter in the preseason and could have earned some work on third downs. Neither Snell nor Ballage has the pass-catching chops that McFarland does. His absence gives Harris a small boost in receiving production and keeps him locked in as a low-end RB1.\n",

    "analysis": "Bengals offensive coordinator Brian Callahan has been adamant that Joe Mixon will stay on the field as much as possible this season after the departure of pass-catching specialist Gio Bernard. Callahan, Morrison reports, could use Perine to spell Mixon so the oft-injured running back can get through the grueling 17-game season. Operating as the team's primary ball carrier for the final two weeks of 2020, Perine, 25, averaged 6.6 yards per carry. In a competitive Week 16 game against Houston, Perine had 136 yards on 17 touches. \"Perine has not only shown explosion and efficiency, but he did it behind a sketchy offensive line that should be a little better \u2014 possibly a lot better \u2014 in 2021,\" Morrison said. He's clearly RB insurance for Mixon drafters, and a sensible late-round target for Zero RB drafters.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Coleman's familiarity with the team's new offense proved insurmountable for Ty Johnson and rookie Michael Carter, leaving Coleman as the default RB1 headed into New York's Week 1 matchup against Carolina. ESPN's Rich Cimini said in June that Coleman has the most straightaway speed\" of any New York back, appearing to be \"shot out of cannon\" once he's made his cut in the famed Shanahan rushing attack. No one's idea of an exciting fantasy option, Coleman should be considered in some deeper fantasy formats against the Panthers. Ty Johnson would likely be next in the pecking order if Carter's concerning preseason usage is any indication. NBC Sports Edge's John Daigle recommended Johnson and Coleman as waiver wire adds this week.\u00a0\n",

Gainwell rushed 12 times for 67 yards (5.58 YPC) this preseason, adding nine receptions for 66 yards. Frank believes Gainwell has popped as a runner in addition to his expected prowess as a pass catcher. It would appear Boston Scott has serious company for the No. 2 job behind Miles Sanders. Gainwell remains worth monitoring in PPR leagues.\u00a0\n",

It's important to remember that although Chase was the best wide receiver prospect since at least Amari Cooper, he is still just a rookie. At this time last year Justin Jefferson was playing behind Olabisi Johnson. Chase ultimately might not live up to his pre-draft hype, or he\u00a0may quickly emerge as a superstar. We won't truly have a strong indication which way things will go until the regular season begins.\n",

The Maryland product has two straight seasons of almost 1,200 yards and has been one of the most productive wideouts in the game since entering the league. It remains to be seen whether the Panthers keep him in the downfield role (13.1 average depth of target) he was in last year or use him underneath more often, but he's a bargain in the fourth round of fantasy drafts regardless.\n",

If the 49ers are giving him any number of reps in a preseason game, his glute is a non-issue. Samuel has suffered a number of injuries since entering the league two years ago. If Samuel is past the glute injury, he should have no problem reaching the regular season at full health. Going far later in drafts than Brandon Aiyuk, Samuel is a sneaky way to buy into the San Francisco offense in fantasy drafts.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Robinson is currently signed to the franchise tag, worth $18 million. The stud receiver has been pushing for a new deal over the past two years but Chicago has been unwilling to pay him top dollar. Assuming no deal gets done in the final hours of the extension window, Robinson will play out 2021 on the tag and prepare to hit the open market next year. The Bears could still choose to tag him again or both parties could come to an agreement before he talks to other teams in free agency. Robinson has racked up 2,397 receiving yards over the past two seasons despite slogging through some of the league's worst quarterback play. Justin Fields has the potential to be the best quarterback Robinson has caught passes from as soon as he earns the starting nod. If Fields exceeds expectations as a rookie, Robinson's value could hit a fevered pitch heading into the 2022 offseason.\n",

Pittsburgh\u2019s third-round pick last season, 2020 was already Johnson\u2019s second time to lead his team in receiving in as many years. His opportunities through the air ranked eighth in the league, falling 22 shy of Stefon Diggs\u2019 NFL-leading mark (166). With JuJu Smith-Schuster set to hit the market as an unrestricted free agent, Johnson is a terrific bet to again lead the Steelers in targets across from Chase Claypool in 2021. Ben Roethlisberger\u2019s contract, which the organization could choose to part with this spring, will ultimately dictate how high Johnson should be valued in offseason fantasy drafts.\n",

Lockett, 29 in September, is coming off his first 100-reception season, though his yards per target and yards per catch plummeted in 2020. He has been a veritable touchdown machine over the past three seasons, racking up 28 scores since the start of the 2018 season. Lockett proved frustrating for fantasy purposes in the second half of the 2020 season, when Seattle abandoned their pass-heavy ways for an ultra-conservative approach. Fantasy's No. 1 receiver in Week 8, Lockett was fantasy 24th highest scoring wideout in the final eight weeks. He shapes up as a slightly undervalued fantasy option if the Seahawks don't seek to establish the run at all costs in 2021. That's a big if.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "DeVante Parker started training camp on the PUP list and Will Fuller has been held out of practice this week with an unspecified injury. Those absences have allowed Waddle to see outside receiver reps with the first team offense, and he has reportedly impressed. Waddle may also be involved in the offense on jet sweeps and screens. It was initially assumed that Waddle would see his work out of the slot in 2021. If he can mix in outside routes and designed plays, he could deliver a sensational rookie campaign.\n",

Rodgers is back for 2021 but there's no guarantee that he'll return next year. As someone who has thrived with Rodgers under center, it's possible that Adams crosses Green Bay off his list if Rodgers isn't there. No matter where he lands, Adams will likely be pushing for\u00a0$25 million per year.\n",

    "analysis": "Brown has been limited to running on a side field since the first week of training camp. Coach John Harbaugh hasn\u2019t put a timetable on when the Ravens expect him back, but\u00a0the lack of practice reps has Brown's Week 1 status in question. The Ravens offense lost starting RB J.K. Dobbins (knee)\u00a0to a potential season-ending injury in their preseason finale, and\u00a0could be without\u00a0both Brown and\u00a0Rashod Bateman (core muscle surgery) for the start of the season.\n",

He\u2019s grown his game. Done this with a lot of players and everybody\u2019s on a different timeline.\" Gage didn't do much with his additional opportunity last year, averaging 6.5 targets and 11 fantasy points in the seven games Julio Jones was absent for. If anything, this news at least guarantees the former stay glued to the field across from Calvin Ridley whether Gage is in the slot or along the boundary. He remains an opportunity-based WR5 for Best-Ball leagues.\n",

The Lions will likely roll with Tyrell Williams, Quintez Cephus, and Amon-Ra St. Brown in three-receiver sets this season. St. Brown is a reasonable late-round pick in PPR formats. Perriman, 28 in September, could land on a practice squad this fall.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Dehner notes that Chase strung four straight impressive practices together this week, which is notable considering his preseason struggles, and the recent reports that he could lose snaps to Auden Tate. It's important to remember that although Chase was the best wide receiver prospect since at least Amari Cooper, he is still just a rookie. At this time last year Justin Jefferson was playing behind Olabisi Johnson. Chase ultimately might not live up to his pre-draft hype, or he\u00a0may quickly emerge as a superstar. We won't truly have a strong indication which way things will go until the regular season begins.\n",

In June, The Athletic's Nate Taylor said\u00a0Hardman \"has made sizable improvements, whether it\u2019s his route running, his consistency when catching the ball or his overall demeanor on the practice fields.\" More playing time and a more diverse route tree should make the speed demon more consistent for fantasy purposes in 2021.

    "analysis": "Johnson had been talked up as a potential fourth receiver option for the Jaguars in camp, but\u00a0the 6'\"6/220 second-year wide receiver was a surprise cut Tuesday. He lands in a crowded situation in New York with Kenny Golladay, Darius Slayton, Sterling Shepard and Kadarius Toney all likely to have sizable roles in 2021. Johnson could ultimately see the field if injuries continue to hamper sideline the starters. The Giants kept John Ross, C.J. Board and Dante Pettis on their final 53-man roster, a sign they may be worried about the health of Golladay (hamstring) and Toney (unknown).\n",

DiCecco sees that highlight as \"merely a byproduct\" of the progress that Reagor made in Monday's joint practice. Head coach Nick Sirianni called Reagor's work in 1-on1s \"special\" and praised his development. Despite these positive reports, it's hard to tell if the Eagles' are truly\u00a0excited\u00a0with Reagor's play, or simply relieved. Reagor struggled through injuries as a rookie and failed his conditioning test to begin camp. Early in camp reports also indicated he was struggling to stand out. Reagor\u00a0will need to build on his recent camp buzz, but if he does, the former first round pick has the requisite talent to deliver a true year-two breakout.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Dehner notes that Chase strung four straight impressive practices together this week, which is notable considering his preseason struggles, and the recent reports that he could lose snaps to Auden Tate. It's important to remember that although Chase was the best wide receiver prospect since at least Amari Cooper, he is still just a rookie. At this time last year Justin Jefferson was playing behind Olabisi Johnson. Chase ultimately might not live up to his pre-draft hype, or he\u00a0may quickly emerge as a superstar. We won't truly have a strong indication which way things will go until the regular season begins.\n",

New England offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels said Henry and fellow prized free agent signing Jonnu Smith -- who was also dinged up in August -- will be ready to go for Week 1.\u00a0\u201cI feel very confident in both players\u2019 aptitude and understanding of our system and our operation and what we do offensively and what their roles are in it,\" McDaniels said. New England should be among the league leaders in two tight end sets this season, making both Henry and Smith viable fantasy options in 12 and 14-team formats. Smith on Monday said he and Henry are \"two alpha males\" pushing each other on the practice field and the weight room. Adjust your ranks.\u00a0\n",

Smith said Pitts -- who has yet to take a preseason snap -- is \"right on schedule\" in learning the offense and his prominent place in it. Fantasy managers should pounce on Pitts if he falls below his fourth round ADP in 12-team formats.\u00a0\n",

With an improved surrounding cast, the arrow is up on Andrews, who should flirt with double-digit touchdowns.\n",

    "analysis": "Gesicki's 10-day stint on the COVID list likely means he's not vaccinated against the virus. Fellow Miami tight end Adam Shaheen said last week he won't be \"strong armed\" into getting the life-saving vaccine, making Miami's tight end room prone to missed time in 2021. The ultra-athletic Gesicki is set for another season as the team's primary pass-catching tight end.\u00a0Tua Tagovailoa targeted tight ends on 31.1 percent of his pass attempts in 2020, with 17.2 percent of those targets going to Gesicki.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Smith, of course, is entering his first year as Atlanta's head coach after coordinating Tennessee's offense for two seasons. The lack of a dominant rusher like Derrick Henry was always going to factor in to how Smith runs the Falcons offense. McDonald said the addition of phenom TE Kyle Pitts could lead to more two-tight end sets for Atlanta after Smith's Titans were fourth in the number of drop backs with two tight ends on the field in 2020. That would mean incumbent tight end Hayden Hurst could still play significant snaps, though it's unlikely he'll get anywhere close to the 88 targets he saw last year. Smith, McDonald said, would likely change the way the tight end operates in his offense after using Jonnu Smith on short routes in Tennessee. McDonald expects Pitts to be used as more of a seam buster who can take advantage of single coverage from secondaries grappling with the Falcons' dangerous pass catchers. Already the fourth tight end off the draft board, Pitts could have a head-spinning ADP by August.\u00a0\n",

Ertz staying with the Eagles takes the shine off Goedert, who profiled as a potentially elite fantasy producer if Ertz had departed. There's little reason to believe Goedert -- the seventh tight end off the draft board -- will have a significant target edge on Ertz in 2021, making the latter a far better fantasy pick considering ADP.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "A month after Henry injured his shoulder in training camp, he said he's \u201cexcited to go out there and compete with [Mac Jones]\" against Miami in the Pats' season opener. New England offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels said Henry and fellow prized free agent signing Jonnu Smith -- who was also dinged up in August -- will be ready to go for Week 1.\u00a0\u201cI feel very confident in both players\u2019 aptitude and understanding of our system and our operation and what we do offensively and what their roles are in it,\" McDaniels said. New England should be among the league leaders in two tight end sets this season, making both Henry and Smith viable fantasy options in 12 and 14-team formats. Smith on Monday said he and Henry are \"two alpha males\" pushing each other on the practice field and the weight room. Adjust your ranks.\u00a0\n",

Kaye deemed the Chargers an ideal trading partner for the Eagles because it would send Ertz to the AFC and to his home state of California. Kaye said the Eagles could probably get a late-round draft pick in exchange for Ertz, 30, whose 2021 cap hit is $12.72 million. LA has almost $20 million in cap space. Ertz ending up with the Bolts would sink Jared Cook's and Donald Parham's 2021 fantasy prospects. Dallas Goedert would likely see an uptick in targets with Ertz gone. The Eagles play the Chargers in Week 9.\n",

    "analysis": "Smith's recovery timetable is four to five months, which puts his entire 2021 season in doubt. Behind Smith, backup Tyler Conklin has recovered from his hamstring injury and set to play in Week 1. Conklin has a career yards per route run of just 1.0, and is unlikely to deliver a strong fantasy season unless he monopolizes tight end snaps. Conklin's chances of doing that took a big hit when the Vikings traded for Chris Herndon Tuesday. The\u00a0former Jet looked like an emerging star as a rookie in 2018. He was then abysmal in his two seasons under Adam Gase, as is customary. If Herndon can recapture his early career form, the pass-catching tight end could be improbably fantasy relevant this season.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Arnold isn't a fit for every offense because he's a low-end blocker, but the former undrafted free agent has some legit skills as a receiving tight end and had a connection to OC Joe Brady from their New Orleans days. He has a career 9.2\u00a0yards per target average and quietly had 438 receiving yards as a part-timer with the Cardinals last year. Only 26 years old, Arnold has some deep-league sleeper appeal as the Panthers' top receiving option at the position. Ian Thomas, who only had 145 yards as the Panthers' tight end last year, will likely head into a backup role.\n",

Ertz staying with the Eagles takes the shine off Goedert, who profiled as a potentially elite fantasy producer if Ertz had departed. There's little reason to believe Goedert -- the seventh tight end off the draft board -- will have a significant target edge on Ertz in 2021, making the latter a far better fantasy pick considering ADP.\u00a0\n",

Callahan, meanwhile, has a strange fascination with five Bengals pass catchers recording 50 grabs this season. The Athletic's Jay Morrison said Joe Burrow \"established an immediate connection\" with Uzomah in 2020, as the tight end saw five targets in Week 1 and six looks in Week 2 before going down with a season-ending Achilles injury in the first half. Drew Sample started the rest of the season for Cincinnati and ran the 12th most tight end routes on his way to a miserable 4.9 PPR points per game. Uzomah, 28, has been fully cleared and is expected to be a full go for training camp. He should be a popular late-round target in the Bengals' pass-heavy offense.\u00a0\n",

The Bills will roll with Knox and\u00a0Tommy Sweeney as their top-two tight ends entering the regular season. Hollister, who had intermittent fantasy relevance in two years with the Seahawks, will land on a roster. It's also possible, as noted by The Athletic's\u00a0Joe Buscaglia, that the vested veteran is re-signed by the Bills following final cuts. This move would help the Bills avoid season ending IR for an injured player. Hollister\u00a0had four catches for 53 yards in three preseason games this month.\n",

In what was likely his last foray in professional football, Tebow, 33, tried to make the team as a tight end. He lasted one preseason game in which he didn't see a target. Signing his longtime buddy was always a questionable move by head coach Urban Meyer, whose first six months as an NFL coach have consisted of nonstop questionable decisions. Meyer said releasing Tebow was a \"tough thing\" but the \"right thing.\" CBS Sports' Pete Prisco, a former Jaguars beat writer, said Tuesday it \"was obvious [Tebow]\u00a0couldn\u2019t play tight end. Any other coach doesn\u2019t even give him a chance.\"\u00a0James O'Shaughnessy or Chris Manhertz will likely start the season as Jacksonville's TE1.\u00a0\n",

    "headlineNews": "Rams selected Purdue TE Brycen Hopkins with the No. 136 overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft.\n",
    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Hopkins (6\u20194/241) was a three-year starter at Purdue who posted a 61-830-7 season as a redshirt senior. Undersized and a below-average blocker, Hopkins will be competing for pass-catching reps at the NFL as a slot tight end or H-back. On tape, he showed burst off the line of scrimmage and created separation with route running and timing, but he was not a fully polished player despite being older. He dropped 22 passes during his career, including eight last season, and only broke 10 tackles on 130 career receptions. His 4.66 speed allows him to win on vertical routes and crosses against slower defenders, but he\u2019s unlikely to be a consistent in-traffic player. A 23-year-old rookie, Hopkins profiles as a specialist\u00a0between the 20s as a quick but undersized pass-catching tight end. The Rams have a loaded tight end room with Tyler Higbee and Gerald Everett, so it will be difficult for Hopkins to find playing time on offense early on.\n",

The continued drumbeat on Granson makes him a very intriguing dynasty target. In 2021\u00a0though, Colts split\u00a0snaps and blocking commitments\u00a0will likely limit all three tight ends to bye week fill-in options and cheap DFS punt plays.\n",

However, unlike most rookie tight ends, Kmet became heavily involved in Chicago's offense by the end of his first season. He tallied 30 targets over his final six games and began pushing Jimmy Graham out of the rotation. Kmet makes for an interesting late-round pick in fantasy drafts but relying on him to be an immediate contributor may be asking too much. Unless Graham disappears entirely, Kmet will be capped at TE2 numbers.\n",

He turned his 20 targets into an impressive 10-159-3 line but used the offseason to hone his skills. Coaches and teammates have noticed his route running has sharpened up, and the Chargers are working to get the ball in Parham's hands more in the open field this summer. Parham has been running with the first-team offense and even spent part of the offseason working out with Justin Herbert to improve their chemistry. With Hunter Henry gone, Parham has a real chance to make some noise in the passing game and red zone. Jared Cook was signed as a veteran option, but he's 34. Parham turns 24 in two weeks. He's a name to remember.\n",

That was out of 16 snaps for the first-team offense. Fantasy drafters have been taking Jarwin as a back-end TE2 after Schultz put up decent counting numbers in Jarwin's 2020 absence. It is more likely the duo cannibalizes each other than Jarwin pushes for top-18 value.\u00a0\n",

The Athletic's Aaron Reiss said Akins and Brown are the team's only pass-catching tight ends going into 2021. Akins, the team's starting tight end for much of 2020, could see significant playing time in Houston's offense this season. Akins last season had a respectable per-game average of 22.9 pass routes and 3.8 targets. The loss of red zone target TE Darren Fells could open up more high-value targets for Akins, who had 14 receptions for 162 yards and a touchdown in the 2020 season's first four weeks before missing time with a concussion.\u00a0The Texans being forced into pass-heavy game scripts could make Akins a decent option in deeper formats this season.\n",

There was some buzz in the first week of August that Blankenship's job was in real danger a year after he logged the fifth most field goals in the NFL. The Colts attempted the fourth most field goals in 2020 -- a key factor in Blankenship's fantasy usefulness. There's no reason to reach for Hot Rod in 2021 drafts, though you could do worse than the second-year kicker in the final round of redraft leagues.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Fantasy football's No. 2 kicker in 2020 is cashing in on a profoundly efficient season in which he made 36 of 39 field goal attempts, banging through all 36 of his extra point tries. He established himself as one of the league's big-footed kickers by nailing eight of nine kickers over 50 yards. Sanders' extension includes a $10 million guarantee. His 2020 numbers stand in stark contrast to his 2019 stats, which include seven missed field goals on 30 attempts. Only the Cowboys and Falcons attempted more field goals than Miami in 2020, giving Sanders the opportunity necessary to become a waiver wire darling in fantasy. Sanders will probably be one of the most over-drafted kickers in fantasy football next season.\u00a0\n",

Lambo's lingering hip injury limited him to four games in 2020 and left the team scrambling for viable kicker options. Jacksonville's cast of kickers hit 18 of their 25 field goal attempts (72 percent), the third lowest rate in the NFL. They were the third worst in extra point conversions too. The most accurate kicker in Jags history, Lambo will have to outplay Rosas this summer if he's to keep his gig in 2021. Rosas -- the seventh highest scoring kicker in 2018 as a member of the Giants -- made eight of 11 attempts last year for Jacksonville. Whoever wins the team's kicker job will have some streaming appeal this season.\n",

The Bears were simply overjoyed by Santos' competent 2020 after years in the kicker wilderness. Santos converted 93.8 percent of his 2020 field goal tries, boosting his career mark to 83.1. Santos is not called on very often from 50-plus yards, making him an extra unlikely recipient of this kind of contract. There's a chance this deal could quickly become an albatross.\u00a0\n",

A splash free agent signing in spring 2020, Phillips has now landed on IR three times in two years, notching just two sacks in nine games. Hardly worth the $18.5 million guaranteed. Phillips hopefully misses the minimum three games and finally starts contributing.\u00a0\n",

With his hold-in finally at an end, it appears as though one side caved in contract negotiations. The Steelers reportedly refused to give Watt any guaranteed money beyond the first year of his extension and are typically done negotiating with players this close to the regular season. Watt's 42.5 sacks and two All-Pro nods over the past three years may have been enough to get Pittsburgh management to bend their rules this time. The Steelers face Buffalo in Week 1 and will need all hands on deck if they want to stop Josh Allen. The return of Watt at least gives them a chance of slowing the Bills' offense down.\u00a0\n",
