Jackson's value will always be high because of his ability to use his legs, but five picks in his past two games after none in the season's opening three weeks is certainly a disturbing trend. Things should ease up Sunday against a winless Bengals squad."

Wilson ended up throwing three more scores, including a game-winner to Chris Carson with 2:28 remaining in regulation. He finished the contest with a season-high 11.7 yards per attempt, and this was the fourth time in five games he completed over 70 percent of his passes.

In Week 6, Ryan and the Falcons' passing game will have a strong chance of keeping up the yardage and scoring against a Cardinals defense that has allowed 12 touchdown passes without forcing an interception this year."

Sunday, he was effective in the box score and on the field, exceeding 250 passing yards for the fourth time in five outings and leading Cincinnati on back-to-back fourth-quarter touchdown drives to knot it up at 23-23 at the two-minute warning, only to see the Bengals defense concede a game-winning 31-yard kick from Zane Gonzalez.

Nonetheless, Haskins will serve as McCoy's only backup Sunday."

        "analysis": "The Jets had been optimistic that Darnold would be ready to go this past weekend for their eventual loss to the Eagles, but the quarterback ended up missing a third straight game after the team's medical staff ruled that he was at too much risk to play in the contest. With Darnold having since regained stamina following his bout with mononucleosis and earning clearance from doctors, he should take all the first-team reps in practice this week as he prepares for his first action since the season-opening loss to the Bills. Luke Falk will slide into the No. 2 quarterback role following a pair of starts."

The fourth-year quarterback now has 117 pass attempts in the last pair of contests following Thursday's hefty workload, once again largely necessitated by the stumbles of the Rams' defense. Goff connected with seven different pass catchers on the night and showed outstanding chemistry with tight end Gerald Everett, who racked up a game-high 136 yards. Goff also had to endure the early exit of Brandin Cooks, who left the game for good in the second half to be evaluated for a concussion. Ultimately, Goff put the Rams in position for a narrow win by spearheading a 10-play, 67-yard drive that set Greg Zuerlein up for a would-be game-winning 44-yard field goal that went wide right with 11 seconds remaining. In the wake of back-to-back crushing losses, Goff and his teammates will look to regroup ahead of a Week 6 divisional clash versus the 49ers a week from Sunday."

The jet-heeled tailback then followed that with a five-yard touchdown catch two drives later. Overall, those contributions fueled Breida's impressive performance, which came while fellow tailback Tevin Coleman returned to the fold following an ankle injury. In his first action since Week 1, Coleman actually led the Niners with 16 carries, gaining 97 yards and scoring once himself. Going forward, it'll be interesting to see how Breida and Coleman split snaps in the backfield, but considering they play in arguably the league's best running scheme -- albeit now potentially without fullback Kyle Juszczyk, who left injured Monday -- there could be enough production to go around for both of them to retain formidable fantasy value."

He did subsequently atone with eight- and 11-yard touchdown runs in the third quarter, giving him back-to-back two-score efforts. However, Gurley's usage, seemingly due to a combination of workload management and game script, continues to be limited; he's yet to exceed 16 carries or 19 total touches from scrimmage in any contest this season. Naturally, fantasy managers who invested significant draft capital in Gurley are disappointed to an extent, and his outlook doesn't figure to be much brighter in a Week 6 divisional battle versus a tough 49ers front seven a week from Sunday."

Not only did Coleman lead the Niners in carries, topping the 11 on which Breida gained 114 yards, but he also scored from 19 yards to end the second quarter. Overall, coach Kyle Shanahan's patented running scheme consistently gashed the Browns defense, enabling both Coleman and Breida to turn in stellar showings. Although fullback Kyle Juszczyk getting injured late could be a development to monitor, thus far it seems Shanahan can get high production from whoever carries the ball, making Coleman and Breida both fairly valuable despite their expected split of snaps going forward."

While the absence of slot receiver Danny Amendola (chest) likely played a role in the distribution of playing time, McKissic arguably flashed more as a runner than as a receiver thanks to a team-high 26-yard scamper in the third quarter.

        "analysis": "Barkley was a limited participant in practice Tuesday while Gallman was held out of the session entirely, but with the Giants facing a quick turnaround for their Week 6 matchup, the team will likely err on the side of caution with its franchise back and hold him out for a third straight contest. If that's the case, the Giants will count Penny and Jon Hilliman as the lone healthy backfield options on the 53-man roster, though the team would almost certainly promote Austin Walter from the practice squad before Thursday to provide additional depth. Though he's listed as a fullback, Penny spent the first two years in the pro ranks as a tailback and owns a 3.9 yard-per-carry mark over 46 career totes. Considering that Hilliman is an undrafted rookie who has delivered underwhelming production to date, it wouldn't be surprising if the Giants ultimately chose to lean more heavily on Penny as Thursday's contest unfolds."

The receptions, receiving yardage and touchdowns were all season highs for Thomas, while his target tally equaled a high-water mark. With a nine-catch, 95-yard performance against the Cowboys in Week 4 having preceded this performance, it's clear Thomas' fantasy value essentially remains almost as robust with Bridgewater under center as with Brees. Thomas will look to follow up Sunday's jaw-dropping numbers when he sees the Jaguars' depleted secondary Week 6."

        "analysis": "Samuel's longest reception on the day went for just seven yards, though he was able to break free a bit for a 16-yard run. His involvement in the passing game is a concern with Kyle Allen under center, as Samuel's longest reception from Allen in three contests is just 15 yards. All told, he's averaging just 9.5 yards per reception in the absence of Cam Newton, holding him back from the breakout season that was widely expected. He'll need to work more down the field in Week 6 against the Buccaneers to return to being a strong starting option."

Green (ankle) remaining week-to-week but not yet returned, and John Ross (shoulder) landing on injured reserve Wednesday, Boyd will continue to be a viable fantasy threat by virtue of a high-volume target share. In Week 6, he and the Bengals' receiving corps will be opposing a Ravens defense that contained Pittsburgh to 203 passing yards as a team, but allowed JuJu Smith-Schuster to rack up seven receptions for 75 yards and a TD on Sunday."

That wasn't due to the same lack of opportunity, however, as Cleveland clearly made a concerted effort to get him involved early. Not only did he pass on the Browns' first offensive play, but he also took two handoffs and was given a desperation punt-return try later on. Unfortunately, Beckham was stripped while attempting to make something out of nothing on that run back, only adding to his frustrations. Coming off back-to-back duds, Beckham will aim to get back on track this Sunday versus the Seahawks, whose pass defense has actually surrendered the seventh-most yards per game to this point in the season."

Godwin arguably has taken the mantle of top week-to-week receiver from Mike Evans, with the latter failing to bring in any of his three targets Sunday.

He nearly added a couple of big gains to his ledger but came up short on several occasions as he hauled in less than half of the passes sent his way. Still, it was a positive sign to see Williams so involved after missing last week's game, and he should be good to go for next Sunday's home matchup against the Steelers."

In the meantime, Landry has taken advantage of less defensive attention, topping 60 yards in all but one game thus far.

Cobb hasn't made much of an impact since Week 1, even with Gallup out the last two weeks following minor knee surgery, and he'll be tough to trust on fantasy rosters moving forward given his limited role in Dallas."

Currently standing as the No. 3 or 4 wideout in Houston's offense depending on the status of Stills, Coutee will carry value as long as Deshaun Watson is producing 300-yard, three-touchdown passing outings.

Howard was far from the only Buccaneers pass catcher to disappoint Sunday, but in his case, the muted production has been a worrisome season-long trend. Howard will look for his first breakout game of the season across the pond against the Panthers during a Week 6 divisional showdown in London."

The Titans' desire to control the ball and work at a slower pace on offense is limiting the upside of most skill-position players -- Walker included.

He still doesn't have the value fellow sophomore Mark Andrews now carries, but it'll be interesting to see how his role develops given Baltimore's relative lack of established targets outside."
