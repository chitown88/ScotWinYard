Allen completed passes of 57, 23, 36, 20 and 43 yards, time and again exposing the defense-less Jets deep. Stefon Diggs was the recipient on three of those 20-plus yard completions as the duo finally got their down-field connection going after a half season of frustration. Allen's scores were a 12-yarder to Diggs and 15-yard wheel route to Matt Breida of all people. For Week 11, Allen will get a Colts defense allowing more big plays than usual in 2021.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

He's now fantasy's QB3 behind Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen, and has a decent shot to finish the year as the top-scoring quarterback in fantasy this season. His 547 rushing yards through Week 10 ranks second only to Lamar Jackson, and his five rushing touchdowns are tied for the most among QBs. Hurts is a prime example of the power of fantasy football's Konami Code. He'll once again be an elite option in Week 11 against the Saints.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "The Tampa offense was lackluster from start to finish, often out-hustled by a hungry Football Team defense. Only one of Brady's two interceptions were his fault, but he was often inaccurate on usually-gimme throws in the pass-heavy Bucs offense. His one highlight was a lengthy touchdown to Mike Evans, taking advantage of single coverage on the outside. Washington crushed the fantasy value of nearly every player in this game with a 20-play fourth quarter drive that prevented Brady and the Bucs from a four minute (or two minute) drive. Brady remains an elite fantasy option in Week 11 against a porous Giants defense.\u00a0\n",

Prescott's touchdowns were first-half hookups with CeeDee Lamb from 13 and nine yards out. The two combined for six connections for 94 yards and their pair of scores. Prescott tacked on a four-yard rushing score in the third quarter. Prescott is a locked-in QB1 and will headed to Kansas City for a Week 11 showdown with the Chiefs.\n",

Although the team responded with one of Joe Mixon's two rushing scores on their ensuing drive, Cincinnati's offense left far too many plays on the field including a fumble and three drops between Tee Higgins and Ja'Marr Chase. Burrow was also pressured for five sacks and another turnover over the course of the game. His managers should expect a significantly better performance when the Bengals return from their Week 10 bye against the Raiders.\n",

Walker will take a backseat to the team's new leader and Sam Darnold (shoulder, IR) probably won't play another snap as a Panther. Newton's Week 11 matchup is undeniably excellent: The pass-funnel Football Team defense has allowed the eighth highest completion rate (67.3 percent) and the seventh highest yards per pass attempt (7.5). His rushing upside make him a high-end QB2 in his first start of 2021.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Cousins bounced back from a rough day in Baltimore with a clean road performance vs. a tough pass defense, albeit one that was a bit undermanned due to injury. Cousins' 294 yards were his most in three weeks, and fourth most of the year. Amazingly, Cousins' TD:INT total is now up to a sparkling 18:2. He is avoiding the red zone mistakes that have so often felled him in the past. For today's scores, Cousins found Tyler Conklin on a pair of gutty end zone targets. Most importantly, he re-heated his connection with Justin Jefferson, finding his superstar sophomore for 9/143, frequently in tight single coverage. Cousins now gets a Week 11 grudge match with a Packers defense fresh off blanking Russell Wilson.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Zach Wilson is reportedly still not 100%. Although one gets the sense that the Jets might be willing to let Wilson test his knee if they had faith in his arm. Flacco's experience is what reportedly got him the nod, with the Jets facing a blitz-heavy Miami defense. The bigger surprise isn't Wilson sitting, but that Flacco was tapped to start over Mike White. White is coming off a meltdown against the league's best defense, but in leading the Jets to a shocking victory against the Bengals he showed an ability to keep the offense on track that the Jets have been lacking all season. Flacco should be viewed as a downgrade for Michael Carter, who had been feasting on White check-down passes. Flacco is at least an upgrade for Corey Davis, who is now the favorite to lead Week 11 in prayer yards.\n",

Booker saw 20 carries before exiting with a hip injury and the New York tight ends and running backs combined for 13 targets. Jones had attempted at least 32 passes in every game he finished before this week so it was a sharp turn for the offense. The run-heavy script was partly prompted by the Raiders' posting just 16 points but it's at least a little concerning for Jones' fantasy outlook. He should be able to turn things around versus the Buccaneers, who have faced over 40 pass attempts per game this year. Jones will clock in as a high-end QB2 when he returns from the Giants' bye in Week 11.\n",

Garoppolo went a perfect 8-of-8 in the first half with an opening-drive eight-yard touchdown pass to George Kittle. Garoppolo later hit Deebo Samuel for a 40-yard score in the fourth quarter, as the two hooked up five times for 97 yards on the night. Garoppolo averaged a pristine 9.6 yards per attempt, his third-best mark of the season. Garoppolo will have some streaming appeal next week in a road date with the Jaguars.\n",

    "analysis": "He added 45 rushing yards on eight carries. This was easily Fields' best to-date game in his young career, throwing for a season-high 291 yards and taking just three sacks while averaging a crisp 10.0 yards per attempt. It was a tale of two halves for the rookie, as he went to the break with less than 100 yards before the Bears eventually fell into a 20-6 hole. Fields had an awesome fourth quarter, however, engineering a pair of touchdown drives, finishing the second off with a 16-yard touchdown strike to Darnell Mooney to give Chicago a 27-26 lead with 1:46 to play. Fields made a number of top-notch throws, particularly while rolling to his left and squaring the shoulders up. He was taking a bunch of deep shots, too, hitting Allen Robinson for a 39-yard gain late after dropping a 50-yarder into Marquise Goodwin earlier. Cole Kmet also led the team with 6-87 receiving. Fields is getting more comfortable but is still just a QB2 for fantasy ahead of a Week 11 date with the Ravens after the bye.\n",

Carter's fourth quarter score nearly didn't happen as he was ruled down at the one-yard following a nifty five-yard run, but he thankfully punched it in two plays later. Carter has now found the end zone in four of his past six games. He is a legitimate weapon out of the Jets' backfield, albeit one who has another difficult Week 11 matchup in the Dolphins. Miami could derail the Jets' entire offense by erasing Zach Wilson.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

Cook also exited the affair without any nicks or bruises, at least that we know of. We would be lying if we said we knew what was going on with Cook's alleged off-the-field issues, but the NFL seems to be in a holding pattern as it waits for new information on the troubling accusations against the back.

Justin Herbert sandwiched Ekeler between two defenders for a tough-as-nails end zone grab. Ekeler ceded a goal-line carry to Larry Rountree, who converted it for his first career score. One way or another, Ekeler is getting home almost every week, though he does have only six grabs for 38 yards over his past two contests. Week 11 opponent Pittsburgh has not been giving when it comes to running back fantasy points.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Nick Sirianni is establishing it like no other. The Eagles, one of just four teams with a neutral pass rate lower than 50 percent of the past three weeks, have been able to keep the ball on the ground thanks to solid defensive play that has kept games close throughout. Philadelphia's pass rate while leading over the past few weeks is a microscopic 31 percent. Jordan Howard, a practice squad player in October, has come out of nowhere to handle 41 carries over that three-game stretch; Boston Scott has seen 33 rushing attempts over that stretch. Unless the Eagles are forced out of their preferred preferred approach, it appears they're going to be among the NFL's run heaviest offenses for the remainder of the season. That will naturally quash target volume for Philly pass catchers.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Jones, who suffered the knee injury late in the Packers' Week 10 win over Seattle, will probably avoid the three-week injured reserve. Jones will miss this week's game against Minnesota and has an outside shot of suiting up for Week 12 against the Rams. Barring a setback, he should be back for Week 14 against Chicago, following the Packers' Week 13 bye. AJ Dillon, meanwhile, will serve as a workhorse back for at least a couple games. Pro Football Focus grades Dillon -- who had 128 total yards and two scores against Seattle -- as the sixth best rusher in the league this season. He has as much upside as almost any running back in fantasy for as long as Jones is sidelined. Patrick Taylor could be sprinkled into the Green Bay offense while Jones is out.\u00a0\n",

The Seahawks badly need Collins with Chris Carson (neck) seemingly unlikely to come off injured reserve. If Collins can play, it will be in a plus matchup with the run-funnel Cardinals. We should have a good idea of his status by the time Friday's official injury designations are released. If Collins can't go, it will be an unideal three-man committee comprised of Rashaad Penny, DeeJay Dallas and Travis Homer. The Seahawks didn't even give Penny a touch in Week 10.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Singletary led the Bills in rushing yards and the backfield in touches, but barely. Not only did he split work with Zack Moss, who notched seven carries, but Matt Breida, who scored two times on six handles after previously not being active since Week 2. So it goes in the Bills' running game, which is arguably the least predictable in the league on a weekly basis. Singletary seems to have the most modest of advantages over Moss right now, but it is impossible to say if Breida will remain involved in Week 11 against the Colts. It's hard to see how he wouldn't after scoring twice today. Singletary will remain a volatile FLEX. Indy has been more giving through the air than on the ground.\u00a0\n",

His 12-yard score came in single coverage on \"Javelin Guidry\" one play after Diggs couldn't quite get both feet in bounds on a would-be touchdown. Diggs has never stopped compiling, but today was just his second 100-yard game of the season.

    "analysis": "Sturm added \"you will find no more lethal inside receiver in the NFL\" than Lamb. \"He is a mismatch nightmare against slot corners.\" We saw as much last week against Atlanta, when Lamb ran nearly 70 percent of his pass routes from the slot on his way to six receptions, 94 yards, and two touchdowns in Dallas' stampeding of the Falcons. Headed into that game, Lamb had run just 23 percent of his routes from the slot. Gallup, meanwhile, ran 86 percent of his routes from the outside in Week 10. More consistent slot usage should put Lamb in favorable matchups for as long as Gallup is healthy and in the Dallas lineup.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Active for the first time since Week 7, Davis (hip) had a decent statistical day in a blowout loss, but essentially ended any shot the Jets had at competing by losing a fumble with 0:26 remaining in the second quarter. Davis was fighting for extra yardage and let the ball get hammered out. That ended a would-be scoring drive and sent the Jets into the break trailing 17-3. Davis was also the intended target on the third of Mike White's four picks, but the miscue was on the quarterback. The Bills easily jumped the route as White stared his receiver down. With Zach Wilson (knee) likely returning for Week 11 against the Dolphins, Davis will be hurting for WR4 juice vs. a defense that just erased the Ravens' lethal passing attack.\u00a0\n",

Smith also bailed Jalen Hurts out at one point in the second half with a pass breakup that would have otherwise resulted in an interception.

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Waddle also drew and end zone DPI on an under-thrown pass to set the Dolphins up at the one-yard line in the fourth quarter. The targets were Waddle's fewest in five games, though he has now caught at least four balls in five straight contests. The highlight was a 35-yard reception late in the third quarter where Waddle knew he was going to take punishment from CB Brandon Stephens. He held onto the ball and helped set the Dolphins up for a field goal. Fantasy managers should rightfully expect more in this targets-bereft offense, and will likely get it against the defense-less Jets in Week 11.\u00a0\n",

Critically, Johnson lost a fumble in overtime, burning his defender for a nice gain, but then allowing the Lions cornerback to punch the ball out. The play nearly lost the game, but the Lions missed the would-be game winning field goal. Johnson also committed offensive pass interference on an end zone target, and then dropped the TD that his penalty would have nullified. Johnson will look to get back on track against the Chargers in Week 11. That will be far more likely if Roethlisberger is back under center.\n",

Back-to-back DNPs are never good no matter who you are, but especially if you are a speed-based wideout. We don't know if Brown is dealing with a muscle pull or contusion. The latter would be much preferable. Brown's status will be updated no later than Friday afternoon.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Jefferson's receptions matched his\u00a0targets\u00a0total from the past two weeks as the Vikings followed through on their pledge to get the squeaky wheel some grease. Facing a tough pass defense, albeit one down a corner, Jefferson simply feasted on man coverage, making one huge sideline grab after another. Amongst today's gains were 18, 21, 21, 27 and 27 yards. Have mercy. Jefferson also drew a DPI. Why the Vikings let Jefferson toil without this kind of work against burnable pass defenses the past two weeks will forever remain a mystery, but they at least got it corrected in a huge road victory. Jefferson will have a tough Week 11 home test in a Packers D that blanked the Seahawks on Sunday.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

Amazingly, Bateman was also on the field for fewer snaps than Devin Duvernay, with Pro Football Focus' Nathan Jahnke charting Duvernay with a 44-40 advantage. Bateman nevertheless made his presence felt, recovering a first quarter Brown fumble, extending into traffic for a critical third down catch in the third quarter, and hauling in an under-thrown deep ball for a 30-yard gain in what amounted to garbage time. He also comfortably out-snapped Watkins, but it's possible Watkins' snap counts will grow. It's also possible that won't happen after Watkins made two massive mistakes, losing a touchdown in the air and committing a fumble six. Bateman will be a high-end WR4 for Week 11 vs. the Bears.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Staley added that the knee issue isn\u2019t why Williams\u2019 production has been trending downward as of late. After starting the year with 471 yards through five games, Williams has just 137 yards on ten catches in the past four weeks. The injury dates back to Week 5. After suffering the knee injury, Williams didn't practice at all leading into the Chargers' Week 6 game versus the Ravens. He ultimately played and was removed from the injury report entirely by Week 9. That far removed from the injury, Staley is probably right about it being a non-factor. Look for Williams to bounce back in Week 11 versus a Steelers defense that could be without multiple key starters.\n",

Headed into that game, Lamb had run just 23 percent of his routes from the slot. Gallup, meanwhile, ran 86 percent of his routes from the outside in Week 10. More consistent slot usage should put Lamb in favorable matchups for as long as Gallup is healthy and in the Dallas lineup.\u00a0\n",

The rookie tight end earned more targets than James Washington (six) and could be the new secondary receiving option with Chase Claypool out, Ray-Ray McCloud's 12 targets notwithstanding. Freiermuth will see a solid boost in upside with Ben Roethlisberger back in the lineup in Week 11. He will be a low-end TE1 against the Chargers unless Mason Rudolph is under center once again.\u00a0\n",

The Lions were able to move the ball effectively at times, but did so through a strong rushing attack. Goff's contributed just 114 passing yards in game that included a full overtime period. Hockenson is becoming increasingly difficult to trust as a fantasy option. He has a bigger role than most tight ends, but also has a suspect ceiling. And, as this week showed, the quality of his offense gives him zero floor. Hockenson will be boom/bust low-end TE1 option Week 11 against the Browns.\n",

The first was a five-yarder where Kirk Cousins found Conklin with an inch of space between two defenders and dared him to catch it. He did. The second was a one-yard grab on a third quarter fourth down where two Chargers defenders took each other out and Conklin was able to catch a floating Cousins pass on his knees. Not bad for a seam stretcher who entered this afternoon with one score on the year. An important part of this efficient passing attack, Conklin will remain a low-end TE1 for Week 11 vs. Green Bay.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

He also drew an end zone look in the third quarter, but it was incomplete and left out of the box score because of a Jets penalty. Josh Allen was focused on his deep game this afternoon, which can involve Knox, but today it was Stefon Diggs and Gabriel Davis. Knox will have a prime Week 11 bounce-back spot in a Colts defense that entered Week 10 permitting the fifth most tight end fantasy points.\u00a0\n",

He only has one game with fewer than seven targets and he's averaging a respectable 61.8 receiving yards per contest, but he's only found the end zone twice all season. Still, Waller remains a high-end TE1 moving forward, and he should be started in all formats against the Bengals in Week 11.\n",

He's typically used his good route running to create separation but lacks the strength to consistently win 50-50 balls through contact. McKeon's receiving production also inexplicably dipped in his final three years at Michigan as he hauled in 31 < 14 < 13 catches from 2017 on. NFL scouts still attest that he's a coachable and reliable teammate, and coach Jim Harbaugh routinely praised McKeon for his fundamental blocking. There are enough skills in the 22-year-old's toolbox to see him stashed on a practice squad while his unimpressive body and build develop.\n",

Callahan, meanwhile, has a strange fascination with five Bengals pass catchers recording 50 grabs this season. The Athletic's Jay Morrison said Joe Burrow \"established an immediate connection\" with Uzomah in 2020, as the tight end saw five targets in Week 1 and six looks in Week 2 before going down with a season-ending Achilles injury in the first half. Drew Sample started the rest of the season for Cincinnati and ran the 12th most tight end routes on his way to a miserable 4.9 PPR points per game. Uzomah, 28, has been fully cleared and is expected to be a full go for training camp. He should be a popular late-round target in the Bengals' pass-heavy offense.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "\u201cHe\u2019s at a point where I think you\u2019re starting to see some more targets go his way,\" Nagy continued. \"I love where he\u2019s at. I love his mentality, and I think he\u2019s going to keep growing.\u201d The coach's sentiments match up with\u00a0Kmet's usage over the last month, culminating in his six-catch, 87-yard performance against the Steelers on Monday night. Chicago's passing game is still not good enough to call\u00a0Kmet a set-and-forget fantasy starter, but streamers should look his way in good matchups. Following the bye, Kmet has one of those good matchups against the Ravens.\u00a0\n",

His usage was solid, but the results were less inspiring: Njoku had one catch on four targets for 11 yards against the Pats. Austin Hooper, meanwhile, led Cleveland tight ends with four catches on five targets for 25 yards and a touchdown. Harrison Bryant caught both of his targets for 18 yards while running the fewest routes of the three Browns tight ends. With more consistent usage in the Browns offense, Njoku could be usable in deeper formats going forward.\u00a0\n",

Austin Hooper, meanwhile, led Cleveland tight ends with four catches on five targets for 25 yards and a touchdown. Harrison Bryant caught both of his targets for 18 yards while running the fewest routes of the three Browns tight ends.

Rudolph could get some extra run until Sterling Shepard returns but his mark of 5.2 yards per target on the year speaks for itself. He can remain off all fantasy rosters.\n",

    "analysis": "Fantasy football's No. 2 kicker in 2020 is cashing in on a profoundly efficient season in which he made 36 of 39 field goal attempts, banging through all 36 of his extra point tries. He established himself as one of the league's big-footed kickers by nailing eight of nine kickers over 50 yards. Sanders' extension includes a $10 million guarantee. His 2020 numbers stand in stark contrast to his 2019 stats, which include seven missed field goals on 30 attempts. Only the Cowboys and Falcons attempted more field goals than Miami in 2020, giving Sanders the opportunity necessary to become a waiver wire darling in fantasy. Sanders will probably be one of the most over-drafted kickers in fantasy football next season.\u00a0\n",

Tucker's heroics saved the Ravens on a day that saw Marquise Brown drop three touchdowns and Baltimore struggle to get anything going on the ground against a middling Detroit front seven. Tucker has made all 16 of his field goal tries in the final minute of the game over his nine seasons in Baltimore. Tucker doesn't have the fantasy upside he had with the Flacco-era Ravens, but he's still an every-week play in 12-team formats.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "McPherson, the 149th pick in the 2021 draft, drilled a 50-yarder against Washington in Friday's preseason game -- a kick that would have been good from at least 60 yards. McPherson is the favorite in the team's kicker competition with veteran Austin Seibert, who has also impressed coaches and beat writers this month. The Bengals offense is among the league's most kicker friendly. Last season, Randy Bullock was fantasy's third highest scoring kicker when Joe Burrow went down with a season-ending knee injury. Fantasy managers should consider McPherson if the game's top kickers are off the draft board.\u00a0\n",

The Bears were simply overjoyed by Santos' competent 2020 after years in the kicker wilderness. Santos converted 93.8 percent of his 2020 field goal tries, boosting his career mark to 83.1. Santos is not called on very often from 50-plus yards, making him an extra unlikely recipient of this kind of contract. There's a chance this deal could quickly become an albatross.\u00a0\n",

He was inactive in Week 5 against the Dolphins and backup kicker Matthew Wright drilled all three of his field goal tries, including a game-winning kick that temporarily relieved Urban Meyer's suffering. Lambo was once among the league's most accurate kickers, making 71 of his 75 field goal tries (94.6 percent) from 2017 to 2019. Wright shouldn't be considered a reliable fantasy option on a Jacksonville team that generates almost no positive game script. Lambo, meanwhile, has a good shot of landing on another team as a fill-in kicker.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Hill went down while attempting to tackle Jakobi Meyers, who would ultimately shed the tackle en route to his first career touchdown. After staying on the field while being examined by medical staff for some time, Hill was placed on a stretcher and taken from the game. He appeared to suffer a head or neck injury while trying to make the tackle. Hill joined the Browns as a free agent in the previous offseason. He has two sacks and four TFLs this year.\n",

With the injury only getting worse, the Bucs are giving him at least three weeks to get past it while on injured reserve. They face the Giants on Monday Night Football this week.

    "analysis": "Harbaugh didn't add any further details, only that Wolfe would not be able to return. The Ravens designated Wolfe to return from injured reserve at the end of October, opening a 21-day window for him to be officially activated. It's possible that he simply won't be able to make it back before the window closes which would permanently send him to injured reserve. Wolfe did not play in 2021 and will look to rebound in the second year of his three-season deal with Baltimore.\u00a0\n",

The two Allens are unlikely to play again for several years, so the Bills quarterback looks like a good buy low.\u00a0\n",
