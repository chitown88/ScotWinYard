It also helped that starting running back Chris Carson's fumble woes resurfaced. Nevertheless, Wilson took over this game and will have a good shot to do the same thing in Week 4 versus the Cardinals, who just allowed Kyle Allen to throw for 261 yards and four scores in his second career start."

He also let the Bengals back into the game, as his third-quarter interception was returned to the 22-yard line, and Buffalo's 14-0 lead was cut in half three plays later. Turnovers continue to be a bugaboo for the second-year quarterback, and he's still a below-average passer who has never thrown for more than 254 yards in a game, but this was the first time this season that he failed to record a rushing touchdown. Allen has guided the Bills to a 3-0 record against a trio of lackluster teams, but the competition gets a lot stiffer in Week 4, when the undefeated Patriots come to town."

Rudolph appeared trapped in a caretaker role for most of the first half as coach Mike Tomlin tried to get by on the team's running game, but once the Steelers fell behind in the second half, the second-year QB started taking some shots downfield and was rewarded with long TD tosses to JuJu Smith-Schuster and Diontae Johnson.

Rodgers otherwise thrilled the Lambeau crowd throughout the contest, shining with touchdown passes to Jimmy Graham and Geronimo Allison, as well as with 10 completions for 180 yards to Davante Adams. The perennial Pro Bowler's ill-timed pick was his first of the season, while Rodgers' 46 rushing yards were easily a season-high figure.

The Titans may consider a switch to Ryan Tannehill at quarterback if Mariota doesn't turn things around Week 4 in Atlanta."

Luckily for Goff's owners, the signal caller gets a favorable matchup this Sunday against a Buccaneers secondary that was just torched for 300-plus yards by rookie Daniel Jones."

ESPN's Jeff Trotter brought up the issue of Mayfield's struggles when holding onto the ball more than 2.5 seconds earlier this week, and Sunday's results reflected those early trends. The 24-year-old was averaging over 300 passing yards through his first two games, but his 3:5 TD:INT ratio will be harder to swallow when he posts yardage totals like Sunday's.

Later, with Denver driving late in the third quarter, he air mailed an interception.

With a star-studded defense in Minnesota, of course, he isn't being asked to do nearly as much to help his team win games. It is a small sample size to this point, but after a typically-prolific 2018 in his debut campaign for the Vikings, Cousins is on pace for a 2019 completion rate of 58.7, with a shade under 2,700 passing yards, and 16 touchdown passes to 11 interceptions. In three full seasons as the starter for Washington, he never threw for fewer than 4,000 yards or 25 touchdowns. He certainly does not project to have a huge fantasy outing in Week 4, taking on a Bears defense that has only surrendered two touchdown passes over its first two appearances of the year."

However, with the ground attack working to the tune of 159 combined rushing yards from Jordan Howard and Miles Sanders, the Green Bay defense was kept honest enough to enable Wentz to find occasional success when dropping back. The fourth-year quarterback hit two of his banged-up pass catchers, Alshon Jeffery and Dallas Goedert, for second-quarter touchdown passes, and he subsequently connected with Jordan Howard for a 20-yard scoring toss in the third quarter. Wentz now has multiple touchdown passes in three of the first four games of the season, and although Thursday's yardage tally was his lowest of the campaign, the 26-year-old did remain free of interceptions for the third contest of the season as well. Having played an integral role in the Eagles evening their record at 2-2, Wentz will turn his sights to building up his numbers against the Jets in a Week 5 battle a week from Sunday."

The Washington State product turned in another interception-free performance against a savvy veteran defensive unit, following an admirable effort in a road loss against the Texans just four days prior. Minshew set the tone early by capitalizing on a Titans' muffed punt with a seven-yard touchdown pass to James O'Shaughnessy, following it up later in the quarter by capping off a six-play, 62 yard march with a 22-yard scoring toss to DJ Chark. The first-year signal caller also helmed a pair of other possessions that ended in field goals and encouragingly avoided any fumbles after losing the handle on three occasions versus Houston. Jacksonville is just 1-2 with Thursday's win, but Minshew's play continues to give the team optimism he can hold down the fort during Nick Foles' (collarbone) absence. Minshew will look to continue his strong play when he faces a tough Broncos defense in Week 4 a week from Sunday."

Through three games, Fournette has an elevated 22 targets, 14 of which he's parlayed into receptions. That type of volume not only fulfills a preseason pledge by the team to get Fournette more involved through the air, it also puts him just four targets short of the amount he saw across eight games last season.

        "analysis": "Freeman finally produced in Week 3 after head coach Dan Quinn alleviated concerns about his health this week, confirming that the veteran back is fully recovered from last year's knee and groin injuries but \"just (hadn't) gotten going yet.\" After rushing for a mere 2.2 yards per carry through the first two weeks of the season, Freeman picked up 5.5 yards per run Sunday against the Colts -- including a 28-yard scamper, his longest since 2017. In Week 4, Freeman and the Falcons' backfield will face a Tennessee defense that has allowed just one rushing touchdown and zero 100-yard rushers through its first three outings of the season."

Barber did contribute several of his trademark power runs in the contest and should continue enjoying a relatively steady role, despite the fact Jones is clearly a more dynamic asset overall. The conundrum for fantasy managers will be figuring out which back will have the hot hand on any given week, as coach Bruce Arians rightfully appears to be firmly committed to sticking with what's working in the backfield on a game-to-game basis. Barber is struggling with his efficiency (4.1 yards per carry or less in each of his first three games), so he'll look to improve in that regard versus the Rams in a Week 4 road tilt."

Sanders also showed well while moonlighting as the Eagles' sole kick returner, and although backfield mate Jordan Howard stole the headlines with three total touchdowns, Sanders' second consecutive strong effort on the ground after a sluggish first two weeks was highly encouraging for the rookie's fantasy managers. Moreover, although he surprisingly wasn't targeted in the passing game, that seems like a clear outlier after Sanders logged 10 looks over the first three contests. The Penn State product will look to build on Thursday's effort in a Week 5 interconference showdown against the Jets a week from Sunday."

So far that plan has worked to perfection, but the load management is leaving fantasy owners hanging in weeks when he doesn't hit paydirt. The one takeaway for Gurley owners was that the back was actually on the field for the majority of the contest, and he received 14 of the Rams' 17 running back carries, so we could see head coach Sean McVay unleash his best offensive weapon in close contests against teams with better secondaries than the Browns currently possess. Gurley will look to find the end zone for the second time this season against a Buccaneers defense on Sunday that has surrendered 25.7 points per game to opponents this season."

This was Carson's fourth fumble in three games, and the coaching staff may be losing faith that he can turn it around. Luckily for Carson, Rashaad Penny (hamstring) was inactive in this contest and Prosise was ineffective on the ground with four rushes for five yards.

Hines hasn't logged more than four carries in any of the first three games, but he already has a pair of four-target tallies over that span and notched a season high in receiving yardage Sunday. The 22-year-old will look to up his contributions at the expense of the Raiders in Week 4."

Howard's pair of rushing scores came in his usual red-zone/goal-line role, as he went in from one and two yards out in the second and fourth quarter, respectively. He sandwiched those visits to the end zone around a 20-yard scoring grab early in the third quarter to cap off a 76-yard drive that erased a slim 21-20 deficit. Howard has now seen his carries increase over that of the prior game in each contest, while his receptions, receiving yards and targets Thursday were all season highs. While the Eagles' backfield situation is far from ideal due to the timeshare between Howard and Miles Sanders, the former looks like a viable play in all formats for a Week 5 interconference battle versus the Jets a week from Sunday."

Those considering the versatile back in lineups this week will still want to verify his status in advance of Sunday's 1:00 p.m. ET kickoff, however. Perhaps a bigger concern with regard to his fantasy upside this weekend is the looming return of pass-catching ace James White, who sat out Week 3's contest. Moreover, Sony Michel is a candidate to see increased touches in the hopes of that he bounces back after logging nine carries for just 11 yards and a TD in his most recent outing. Burkhead therefore profiles as a deeper league/flex option, whose weekly volume is at the whim of a coaching staff that tends to script carry allotments dictated by game flow and matchup-specific game plans."

He didn't get to work every day this week, but he did finish out the week going. So that's a good sign,\" coach Pete Carroll said.",
        "analysis": "Sidelined Week 3 by a strained hamstring, Penny remained a non-participant Wednesday before wrapping up the week with back-to-back capped showings. As intimated by Carroll, the development is a sign that Penny is trending toward a return Sunday. In that scenario, Penny may not receive more than the 9.5 touches per game that he averaged the first two weeks of the season. That said, starter Chris Carson has lost three fumble through three games, a trend that, if it continues, eventually could vault Penny into a bigger role."

        "analysis": "Jones went up and corralled a 10-yard touchdown pass from Matt Ryan in the fourth quarter, out-muscling Colts defensive back Quincy Wilson for the jump ball and getting Atlanta within a field goal with four minutes and change remaining in the game. Atlanta was unable to close the gap or overtake Indianapolis from there, but Jones continues to prove himself as a fantasy rock star, with two 100-yard outings and four touchdown catches on the young season. Week 4 presents a matchup against a Tennessee defense that has given up five touchdown passes over its past two games."

It was JuJu's first touchdown of the year, but he's delivered steady production otherwise, coming up with at least 78 yards in all three games to date. With Ben Roethlisberger (elbow) done for the year, the Steelers' No. 1 WR will get plenty more chances to develop his connection with Rudolph further."

It's also a positive sign that there were simply more targets to go around with Russell Wilson throwing a career-high 50 times. That won't be replicated in every game, but coach Pete Carroll showed his willingness to favor the pass when necessary. Look for Lockett to carry this momentum into Week 4 against the Cardinals, who have allowed at least 250 passing yards in every game."

Williams' catch and receiving yardage totals have trended downward over the past two weeks since he logged six catches for 105 yards in the season opener, but he looks to reverse that trajectory in Week 4 against a Colts defense that allowed three Falcons players to exceed 65 receiving yards in its last time out."

Chark recorded his third touchdown in as many games midway through the first quarter with a nifty contested catch in the left corner of the end zone, one in which he admittedly appeared to get away with a slight push-off on cornerback Malcolm Butler. Chark has shown impressive rapport with rookie quarterback Gardner Minshew through the latter's two-plus games at the helm, and although he's been unable to duplicate his spectacular 4-146-1 line from the opener, he's nevertheless cemented himself as a dependable passing-game/fantasy option through three contests. He'll look to conquer the challenge of a tough Broncos secondary in a Week 4 matchup a week from Sunday."

The veteran brought Washington within two scores with a two-yard touchdown grab to start the fourth quarter, giving him a trip to the end zone in back-to-back weeks. Although rookie Terry McLaurin has been the main standout among the team's receivers, Richardson sports decent momentum ahead of Week 4's game at the Giants."

Nelson as well as tight end Darren Waller hogging 14 targets from quarterback Derek Carr. An ankle injury held Nelson to just eight total snaps throughout the first two weeks of the season, but he's clearly the No. 2 receiver behind Tyrell Williams when healthy. Renfrow will retain value in deeper leagues as the slot man, however, especially given the Raiders' habit of falling behind early and often as consistent underdogs."

The fifth-year wideout was able to salvage his fantasy line with a pair of second-half touchdown catches from 20 and two yards out, but he also committed an unforced fumble after a second-quarter reception at the Lions' 40-yard line. Agholor is in line for another pivotal role in Thursday's Week 4 tilt against the Packers with Jackson already ruled out, while the short turnaround could also result in Jeffery missing a second straight contest."

A third-round pick in this year's draft, Johnson will likely remain a fairly low-volume big-play threat moving forward, but the Steelers don't have an established No. 2 option in the passing game behind JuJu Smith-Schuster. If Rudolph and the rookie continue to click, he could wind up putting together a surprisingly productive campaign."

The second-year receiver saw the Eagles' Craig James get his hand on the ball and tip it, sending it into the arms of Nigel Bradham for a game-clinching interception. It was an underwhelming night overall for Valdes-Scantling, who had put together a season-high 6-99-1 line in Week 3. The 24-year-old will look to bounce back in a Week 5 showdown against the Cowboys a week from Sunday."

The Texans have allowed 90 yards to TEs this season, facing Jared Cook, James O'Shaughnessy and Virgil Green. Initial feedback suggests the change from Cam Newton (foot) to Kyle Allen at quarterback isn't a negative development for Olsen's fantasy value."

Nevertheless, Ebron's past success in this offense and Jacoby Brissett's considerably  improved play early this season offers reason for optimism that even more productive days are ahead.

While the fact Howard saw only four targets Sunday is somewhat concerning, it's important to keep that general scarcity of looks in perspective. The pass distribution was extremely top-heavy for the Buccaneers on Sunday, with Mike Evans leading the way with 15 targets and no other player logging more than Howard's tally otherwise, including the previously surging Chris Godwin. Therefore, Howard remains a risky but high-upside asset in season-long and daily formats heading into a Week 4 matchup versus the Rams."

Fant has plenty of athleticism, continues to have a commanding lead in snaps, and seems bound to have a big game or two in the not-so-distant future, but Sunday's fumble is one in a series of reminders that the former Hawkeye just isn't there yet."

The heavy involvement may be a one-game anomaly, but it could develop into a more consistent element of the offense if opponents devote more resources to Houston's wideouts."

Andrews is still the primary TE weapon in Baltimore, but sophomore quarterback Lamar Jackson obviously has comfort throwing to other tight ends, and offensive coordinator Greg Roman is a former tight-ends coach himself, so Boyle might have himself a couple of productive games even out of the TE2 spot."

The veteran tight end at least had a pair of touchdown receptions nullified by penalty in the opener, lending credence to the notion he would still remain a viable red-zone threat as a complementary piece to starter O.J. Howard. However, Brate only has one official red-zone target on the season otherwise, and it's the team's receivers that are getting the majority of attention from quarterback Jameis Winston early on. Those looking for any sliver of optimism in Brate's uninspired Week 3 numbers can point to the fact his snap count jumped from 18 to 32 from the Week 2 victory against the Panthers, but there's no denying his fantasy outlook is bleak at present."

Meanwhile, Hockenson has caught just two of seven targets for eight yards in two games since the season opener in the desert.

With fellow tight ends Greg Olsen (foot) and Ian Thomas both under contract for 2019, it appears Manhertz is headed for another season working as a blocking specialist."

For context, that was two teams ago for Stocker, as he was playing for the Buccaneers at the time, and his opponent that day, the Rams, were still playing in St. Louis. He is not likely to get the requisite passing game involvement to be a viable weekly fantasy starter, but if there's any week Stocker has a chance to fall into the end zone it may be in Week 4 against his former team, Tennessee. Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan has three touchdown passes in each of his past two outings, and the Titans have allowed a tight end touchdown catch in three straight games to begin 2019."
