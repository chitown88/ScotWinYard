After a stunning Week 10 loss to Washington where Brady went for 220 yards, two scores, and a pair of picks, Brady was pretty flawless in this one with his lone interception coming on a drop by Mike Evans deep in Tampa territory that led to the Giants' lone touchdown. Brady's two touchdown throws were 13- and five-yard hookups with Chris Godwin and Mike Evans. In the midst of the easy win, Brady eclipsed 3,000 yards for the season, doing so for the 19th time in his career, claiming sole possession of the most times in NFL history, breaking his tie with Brett Favre. Brady and the Bucs will go to Indianapolis next week.\n",

Dallas' 14 penalties for 166 yards set a franchise record for most penalty yards in a game. Prescott was terrific otherwise, finding Cedrick Wilson for a 51-yard grab in the first half and Michael Gallup for catches of 41 and 32 yards in the fourth quarter before hitting Dalton Schultz for a 32-yard score to tie the game at 30 all. Prescott's lone mistake was a costly one, overthrowing Malik Turner on third down in overtime and forcing the team to punt. With Lamb and Cooper both expected back on Thursday night against New Orleans, Prescott will remain a confident QB1 in Week 13.\n",

    "analysis": "Allen picked apart the Saints\u2019 defense with ease, finding Dawson Knox for a pair of scores that propelled the young tight end to a franchise record for receiving touchdowns in a season. He connected with Stefon Diggs and Matt Breida for his other two scores. Allen did have two blemishes on the day. Both of his interceptions were questionable throws and he now has at least one interception in four consecutive games. That is the longest streak of his career. Allen\u2019s 2021 campaign has been a bit more up-and-down than his 2020 season but he showed his ceiling as a passer and a fantasy option once again this week. Allen remains a strong QB1 option versus a surging New England squad next week.\n",

Cousin threw an interception in the first quarter that was negated by a roughing the passer penalty. He nearly threw a deep interception later in the game that Adam Thielen broke up, and was then strip-sacked to close the third quarter. Worst of all, he threw a potentially game-losing interception right before the two minute warning, but it was overturned on review. Cousins also had some incredible throws, including a beautiful 56 yard deep shot to Justin Jefferson. And following his nearly disastrous interception, Cousins marched the Vikings down the field and set them up for a game-winning field goal. Fantasy managers have to take the bad with the good, but Cousins has played well this season and sets up as a QB2 against the 49ers in Week 12.\n",

His rushing touchdowns alone were enough to bury Buffalo but he also added a receiving score to his stat line. Taylor's massive outing masked a lackluster performance from Wentz, who completed just 55 percent of his passes at 5.3 yards per attempt. Wentz saw his streak of six multi-touchdown games come to an end last week and his slump is now at two games after this game. He'll be in a great spot for a rebound versus the Bucs next week. No defense faces a higher pass rate over expectation, boosting Wentz to the top of the QB2 ranks for Week 12.\n",

    "analysis": "Whoa Nellie. Hurts' scores went for one, three and 24 yards. For the second, he extended past the pylon as he went out of bounds. For the third, he broke ankles and tackles on a read option keeper. Hurts entered this afternoon with zero rushing scores in his past four contests. He exited it with this third multi-rushing TD effort of the season. He also keyed an extremely rare 200-yard team rushing day vs. the Saints, just the second in the past six years. The other, you may remember, was another Hurts-led Eagles attack last season. It has come against a tissue-soft schedule, but the Eagles have done an excellent job harnessing Hurts' unique skill-set over the past month. Amazingly, they have five straight plus matchups in a row with next week's @NYG followed up by @NYJ, vs. WFT, vs. NYG and @WFT.\u00a0\n",

Garoppolo missed Wilson wide open for a two-yard touchdown on that opening drive but connected with Brandon Aiyuk (7/85/1) and George Kittle (4/34/1) to put the Jaguars away with a 27-3 lead early into the third quarter. With a 100-plus passer rating in four consecutive starts, Garoppolo will continue to be a quality streamer in Week 12 against the Vikings.\n",

Joe Mixon totaling 123 yards and two scores on the ground also hurt Burrow's odds of posting a successful fantasy line. He somewhat salvaged his day with a fourth-quarter score to Chase in the red zone. Burrow gets a tough matchup with the Steelers next week, keeping him outside of the QB1 ranks.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "He also did nothing on the ground with two carries for two yards. In two games since returning from I.R. with his finger injury, Wilson has thrown for 161 and 207 yards with no touchdowns and a pick. The Seahawks couldn't even beat the Kyler Murray- and DeAndre Hopkins-less Cardinals, knocking Seattle to 3-7, pretty much ending any hope of a postseason appearance. Wilson gets a tasty Week 12 on-paper date with Washington next week, but he's shown nothing to instill any QB1 confidence. This offense looks completely broken.\n",

Regardless, Carr was sensational through the air, completing seven of his 15 passes that traveled 10-plus yards downfield for 220 yards and one score, opening the game with a 56-yard bomb to DeSean Jackson (3/102/1) over the middle of the field. Carr also kept his rapport with Hunter Renfrow for a 54- and 31-yard gain in the second half, even moving the chains with his legs at one point with a 22-yard run, the fourth-longest of his career, on a crucial 3rd-and-11. The 6-5 Raiders and Carr are served another juicy matchup against Washington in Week 13.\n",

There's clearly a tension between the way Football Team coaches want to play on offense and\u00a0Heinicke's high-wire act, complete with fall-away throws and across-the-body attempts. It's worked for some of the season though, and we can expect Washington to run a conservative offense whenever game script allows.\u00a0Heinicke should be a decent superflex option in Week 12 against Seattle.\u00a0\n",

    "headlineNews": "NFL.com columnist Jim Trotter said there's a \"growing perception that the more physical and muddy an opponent makes the game, the less the Rams like it.\"\n",
    "report": "",
    "analysis": "The Rams have been physically dominated on both sides of the ball over the past couple weeks. In Week 9, the Derrick Henry-less Titans beat the Rams 28-16 while sacking Matthew Stafford five times and picking him off twice. The 49ers on Monday night intercepted two Stafford passes -- one for a touchdown -- while pressuring him throughout and sacking him twice. It's a curious trend for a Rams offensive line graded by Pro Football Focus as the best pass-blocking unit in the NFL. Stafford has been terrible under pressure over the past two games, completing six of 18 passes for 37 yards. On Monday night, the Niners defense overwhelmed the Rams, especially when LA was forced into obvious passing situations. Cooper Kupp is likely the only Rams player who can withstand the team's offensive struggles. Sean McVay will try to right the ship during the Rams' Week 11 bye.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Outside of a disastrous Week 6 against the Rams, this was easily Jones' worst game of the season, and it came on national television in ugly fashion. Jones and the Giants marched down the field on the opening possession only to stall in the red zone before settling for a field goal. It was all bad after that, as Jones' touchdown was a gift via a Mike Evans drop that goes on the books as a Tom Brady interception. It was returned inside the 10-yard line, and Jones tossed a two-yard score to LT Andrew Thomas on a trick play to finish it off. Jones' two interceptions were truly idiotic throws. One was right to NT Steve McLendon with no Giants player in the vicinity, and the second a forced pass to Darius Slayton. This was Jones' second multi-INT game of the year. He'll try to forget it and move on to a Week 12 home game against the Eagles as a middling QB2.\n",

Lawrence's underwhelming performance since Jacksonville's Week 7 bye also continued into Sunday, completing 56% of his passes for one touchdown, one interception, and 4.8 yards per attempt in his last four starts. His only accomplishment in this one was permitting Nick Bosa to match his career-high in sacks (9) less than 10 full games into his post-ACL season. The Falcons offer a terrific bounce-back spot on paper for Lawrence in Week 12, but he should not be trusted as anything more than a QB2 for SuperFlex leagues at this point.\n",

Goff would throw for just 107 more yards the rest of the afternoon, however. Losing D'Andre Swift to a shoulder injury didn't help.

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Having undergone multiple surgeries on his throwing shoulder in recent years, Newton's ability to make downfield throws -- a former strength of his -- was in question when Carolina signed him as their starter this month. Newton completed 21 of his 26 attempts for 189 yards (7.26 yards per attempt) in his Week 11 start against Washington, but completed just one pass of more than 19 yards. Rhule said the lack of downfield passing was due to offensive coordinator Joe Brady's game plan. \u201cTypically, since we\u2019ve been here, Joe\u2019s been more of an underneath, passing game guy,\" Rhule said. \"We have to continue to push the deep passing game. ... So I wouldn\u2019t put that on (Newton). I know that\u2019s kind of a narrative right now.\" More down-the-field attempts would give D.J. Moore and Robby Anderson some sort of fantasy ceiling in a Cam-led offense. For now, only Moore -- who had 50 yards and a touchdown on five catches against Washington -- has a decent statistical floor.\u00a0\n",

Their lone score was an 11-yards strike to Nick Vannett after the game was mostly out of hand. Taysom Hill did not play a snap but the broadcast noted that he is still working his way back from his concussion earlier in the year. It's hard to believe that New Orleans will continue limiting his workload of Siemian's atrocious performance. Expect the Saints to strongly consider benching Siemian in Week 13 versus the Cowboys. Siemian holds no fantasy value and no receiver on this team can be trusted.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "For better or worse, Dalton helped save coach Matt Nagy's job with his first 300-yard game of the season. Touchdown drives were elusive, though Dalton did help orient the Bears for three field goals, including the game-winner with :01 remaining. That one could have been a touchdown with the Bears having 1st-and-goal from the four, but this being Nagy, the field goal was the play. Dalton's touchdown was a 17-yard strike to Jimmy Graham of all people. For the second straight week, the Red Rifle relentlessly worked his connection with Darnell Mooney, finding the sophomore speedster for 5/123 on eight targets. Justin Fields (ribs) is expected to be healthy enough to return for Week 13 against the Cardinals, but Dalton probably gives the Bears their best chance to win right now.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Taylor put on a clinic in Buffalo even while getting some rest in the closing minutes of the game. No defender stood a chance at tackling him and he broke a trio of plays that went for more than 20 yards, one of which came on his impressive receiving score. He also set the Indianaoplis franchise record for rushing plus receiving touchdowns scored in a game. This was his eighth straight game with a touchdown. Taylor is one of the league's best runners while also getting plenty of goal line and receiving work. He now sits as the fantasy RB1 and is unlikely to give up that throne anytime soon. Taylor will face his greatest test yet next week as he and the Colts take on the Buccaneers. Still, a player as game-breaking as he is shouldn't be affected by a difficult matchup.\u00a0\n",

Elliott was fortunate that Pollard was stopped short of the goal line after a 14-yard catch-and-run, allowing the former to come off the bench and plow ahead for a one-yard score. Hopefully the seven days between Dallas' Thursday night turnaround against New Orleans are enough for Elliott to fully heal.\n",

Jefferson appeared to score, but there wasn't a conclusive angle to overturn the call. Cook got going as the game went on, however. He began ripping off runs up the middle in the third quarter and had the final 12 yard rush that set the Vikings up for their game-winning field goal. He also had a nice 19 yard catch and run earlier in the drive. Cook will be a clear-cut RB1 against the 49ers in Week 12.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Sanders also lost a fumble at the Eagles' own four-yard line early in the second quarter, setting up a Saints touchdown. Amazingly, Sanders did it again from the Eagles' own four near the first half two-minute warning, but dubiously, his forward progress was ruled stopped. Before fumbling on that play, he mishandled the snap. Jordan Howard finished the half and entered the break out-carrying Sanders 9-8. Howard then went down early in the third quarter with a knee injury and did not return. It's fair to wonder how much work Sanders would have ended up with without Howard's injury, but he took the rock eight times in the second half. Boston Scott mixed in for only eight touches for 18 yards. Sanders ended up with three carries of 10-plus yards, so he did put some good things on film against a tough run defense. Jalen Hurts, however, vultured all three of the Eagles' rushing scores. Sanders' final Week 12 ranking against the Giants is going to depend on Howard's health, but he will at least be a FLEX.\u00a0 \u00a0\n",

Rex Burkhead is the Texans' nominal RB1 while David Johnson handles some pass-catching duties. The Ravens' extremely washed backfield could benefit from a Lindsay addition.\u00a0\n",

DeSean Jackson's 30-yard DPI in the first quarter also set up Jacobs to plow in for a one-yard touchdown to put the team up 14-6 early. Drake notably didn't touch the ball until the 11:09 mark in the second quarter. With an increased role and at least four targets in every game without Henry Ruggs the past month, Jacobs will again be a touch-based RB2 against Washington in Week 13.\n",

Fournette had a big gain on a screen called back on a highly questionable illegal formation penalty against Mike Evans. Jones also vultured a six-yard touchdown in the second quarter on the lone drive the coaches gave Fournette a break. Lenny has 14 catches over the last two weeks and is on pace for 75 grabs this season after catching 36 a year ago. Fournette is an every-week RB2 with upside and will get a date with the Colts next Sunday.\n",

Singletary should have a floor of double-digit carries whenever Moss is scratched but Breida remains the more explosive back and could see his role grow after another successful game.

Even so, it was Gordon who coughed up Denver's nail in the coffin in the third quarter, losing a fumble and seeing the Eagles immediately take a 27-13 lead. Williams also exploded for a 20-yard touchdown run that was negated for holding at the line of scrimmage. With a Week 11 bye potentially prompting a role change, Williams should at the very least be traded for before the Broncos return in Week 12 against the Chargers.\n",

Barrows said Mitchell -- who last week had surgery on a broken finger on his right hand -- \"seemed to hold the ball exclusively in his left hand\" during the practice. Mitchell's Week 12 availability against Minnesota is \"up in the air,\" according to Barrows. The 49ers hyper-conservative offense is primed for another run-heavy game against a Vikings defense missing DT Dalvin Tomlinson (COVID-19), DT Danielle Hunter (torn pec, IR), and possibly Everson Griffin. The last time the Niners played the Vikings was in January 2020, when San Francisco rushed 47 times for 186 yards and two touchdowns. Look for Deebo Samuel to continue seeing at least a handful of rushing attempts behind Jeff Wilson if Mitchell is sidelined against the run-funnel Vikings.\u00a0\n",

Johnson has been used frequently on third downs and in two-minute scenarios for the Jets this season, but he could see more early-down work if Carter is sidelined.\n",

Tyler Boyd and Ja'Marr Chase combined for 14 of Joe Burrow's 29 attempts and the ball was spread around after that, resulting in a nonexistent day from Higgins. Based on his production in every other game this year, it's safe to bet on a return to form from the second-year receiver. He'll look to do so versus the Steelers in Week 12.\n",

Gallup should still be considered a WR3 with upside in Week 13 against New Orleans.\n",

    "analysis": "Sutton's deal comes with $34.9 million guaranteed. The 26-year-old wideout comes to terms with the Broncos during a three-game statistical slump that coincides with the return of Jerry Jeudy from an early-season ankle injury. Sutton has five catches for 79 scoreless yards over that three-game stretch -- a stark departure from his productive, target-dominating ways of September and October. Sutton, who made a full recovery from a 2020 ACL tar that ended his season after one and a half games, is clearly a lynchpin of a Broncos offense loaded with talent. The WR33 in fantasy this season, he'll likely be a solid fantasy producer for years to come.\u00a0\n",

Mooney's longest grab this afternoon was a 52-yarder where he ran right by S Will Harris. Even if Robinson returns for Week 13 vs. the Cardinals, Mooney has earned every-week WR2 treatment until further notice, though Andy Dalton keeping the job over Justin Fields (ribs) would probably help.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

His 103-yard day felt like a 203-yard outing. Nevertheless, McLaurin dominated a tough Carolina secondary from start to finish as Washington's target dominator. McLaurin's peripheral numbers have been solid all year -- it's just a matter for Heinicke connecting with his best pass catcher. Next week McLaurin will go against Seattle's secondary, one of the league's most generous. He'll be a borderline WR1.\u00a0\n",

One of his missed connections was an end zone target.

Usually deployed as a possession receiver close to the line of scrimmage or at the sticks, Renfrow's 54-yard reception in the third quarter was actually the second-longest reception by air yards (41) of his career, tacking on a 31-yard catch earlier in the game, too. His floor-ceiling combo should be viewed even higher in Week 13 if Darren Waller (knee) can't go.\n",

That is a nice payday for a player who entered the league as an undrafted free agent and was playing 2021 on a second-round tender. This move is an interesting tea leaf considering Courtland Sutton is scheduled to be a free agent following the season. It is possible Denver wants to keep the entire receiver room together, but this deal could also hint Sutton will be allowed to test the market next spring.\u00a0\n",

After keeping his PPR game afloat this afternoon with his second most catches of the season, Andrews will remain a top-three option for Week 12 vs. Cleveland with Jackson almost certainly back under center.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "McKeon (6'3/242) made 23 starts across 40 appearances for the Wolverines, missing three games in 2019 with a leg injury. He's typically used his good route running to create separation but lacks the strength to consistently win 50-50 balls through contact. McKeon's receiving production also inexplicably dipped in his final three years at Michigan as he hauled in 31 < 14 < 13 catches from 2017 on. NFL scouts still attest that he's a coachable and reliable teammate, and coach Jim Harbaugh routinely praised McKeon for his fundamental blocking. There are enough skills in the 22-year-old's toolbox to see him stashed on a practice squad while his unimpressive body and build develop.\n",

The Eagles might have won a review but instead of waiting around they went hurry up, and Jalen Hurts punched the ball in for a one-yard score. As such, Goedert remained scoreless for the sixth straight game. As for the compiling, he was lucky to post the numbers he did, as Hurts attempted only eight passes after halftime in a lopsided contest. 4/48 of Goedert's production came in the first half. The Giants are not a concerning Week 12 matchup, but the risk for Goedert will remain the Eagles going fully established on the ground and limiting their passing volume.\u00a0\n",

With that being said, five catches for 50 yards is still a strong performance for a tight end, and the target numbers have been robust all season long for the 26-year-old. Consider Gesicki a mid-to-low TE1 in Week 12 against the Panthers.\n",

He showed viable but lower-end athleticism in Indy, running 4.89 with a 7.18 three-cone time and 31-inch vertical. Competing for Will Grier\u2019s targets with David Sills and Gary Jennings, Wesco was largely a passing-game afterthought in college but earned scouting raves for his in-line and lead blocking with dominant flashes on tape. Wesco projects as a Nick Boyle-level pro as a probable No. 2 tight end. His selection is bad news for Eric Tomlinson.\n",

His second score of the day gave him the single-season touchdown record for a Buffalo tight end. Knox plays on most of Buffalo's offensive snaps and has a prominent role in the red zone. He's a weekly TE1 going forward.\n",

The Bears were simply overjoyed by Santos' competent 2020 after years in the kicker wilderness. Santos converted 93.8 percent of his 2020 field goal tries, boosting his career mark to 83.1. Santos is not called on very often from 50-plus yards, making him an extra unlikely recipient of this kind of contract. There's a chance this deal could quickly become an albatross.\u00a0\n",

Buffalo tried out kickers Matthew McCrane (Kansas State), Tristan Vizcaino (Washington), and Ramiz Ahmed (Nevada). Bass, who made a meager 20 of 28 field goal tries last year at Georgia Southern, would make a decent fantasy option in Week 1. Buffalo is a 6.5-point home favorite against the Jets.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Patterson (5\u201910/181) was a three-star prospect that was rated as the 16th best kicker from the 2017 prep class. The Edwardsville, IL native struggled a bit as a freshman, converting 69 percent of his field goals while registering only two touchbacks on 24 kickoffs. However, Patterson showed consistent year-over-year improvement throughout his career, boosting his conversion rate to 75 percent in 2018 and 92 percent in 2019. In addition to his on-point accuracy, Patterson converted five-of-six attempts of 50 or more yards two seasons ago. His production slipped a bit in 2020, making 15-of-22 attempts, but five of those misses came from beyond the 50-yard threshold, so that should be accounted for. Though he doesn\u2019t possess the most imposing leg in the class, his touchback rate was decent, as 38-of-63 kickoffs were not returned. He will need to iron out his conversion rate if he is going to stick around at the NFL level. The Vikings only have one other kicker rostered, third-year boot Greg Joseph, who has just 20 career field goal attempts. Expect a true kicking completion to take place between Joseph and Patterson if the Vikings don't bring in anyone else.\n",

The Bengals offense is among the league's most kicker friendly. Last season, Randy Bullock was fantasy's third highest scoring kicker when Joe Burrow went down with a season-ending knee injury. Fantasy managers should consider McPherson if the game's top kickers are off the draft board.\u00a0\n",

Carlson converted 94.3 percent of his 2020 field goal attempts after he was a far worse 73.1 percent in 2019. Carlson was 4-of-4 beyond 50 yards last season as he quietly finished as fantasy's fourth highest scoring kicker thanks largely to the NFL's seventh most attempts. He'll likely be overdrafted in seasonal leagues this season. Coach Jon Gruden evidently believes the 26-year-old is his \"kicker of the future.\"\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "The Jaguars had little choice but to cut ties with their kicker of five seasons. Lambo had whiffed on all three of his field goal attempts and two extra points this season. He was inactive in Week 5 against the Dolphins and backup kicker Matthew Wright drilled all three of his field goal tries, including a game-winning kick that temporarily relieved Urban Meyer's suffering. Lambo was once among the league's most accurate kickers, making 71 of his 75 field goal tries (94.6 percent) from 2017 to 2019. Wright shouldn't be considered a reliable fantasy option on a Jacksonville team that generates almost no positive game script. Lambo, meanwhile, has a good shot of landing on another team as a fill-in kicker.\u00a0\n",

    "headlineNews": "Dolphins signed kicker Jason Sanders to a five-year contract extension worth $22 million.\u00a0\n",
    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Fantasy football's No. 2 kicker in 2020 is cashing in on a profoundly efficient season in which he made 36 of 39 field goal attempts, banging through all 36 of his extra point tries. He established himself as one of the league's big-footed kickers by nailing eight of nine kickers over 50 yards. Sanders' extension includes a $10 million guarantee. His 2020 numbers stand in stark contrast to his 2019 stats, which include seven missed field goals on 30 attempts. Only the Cowboys and Falcons attempted more field goals than Miami in 2020, giving Sanders the opportunity necessary to become a waiver wire darling in fantasy. Sanders will probably be one of the most over-drafted kickers in fantasy football next season.\u00a0\n",
