    "report": "Mahomes completed 31 of 42 passes for 385 yards and four touchdowns in Monday night's 34-20 win over the Ravens. He also rushed four times for 26 yards and another score.Mahomes brought out his bag of tricks, finding the end zone in a variety of ways. The quarterback started by scampering in from three yards on the ground, then threw an underhand shovel pass to fullback Anthony Sherman for his second score. For his next act, Mahomes connected with speedy wideouts Tyreek Hill and Mecole Hardman on superb touchdown tosses prior to halftime, showing his signature arm strength and touch. To cap things off, the reigning Super Bowl MVP found his starting left tackle, Eric Fisher, of all people, for a two-yard exclamation point on the evening. Through three games, Mahomes now sports nine passing touchdowns versus zero interceptions, which along with Monday's win puts him in great standing ahead of another AFC showdown versus the Patriots in Week 4.",

Just as he has throughout the early stages of his NFL career, however, Burrow maintained his composure, orchestrating a 12-play scoring drive in the fourth quarter that provided his team with a seven-point lead at the 3:05 mark. Cincinnati's defense could not hold Philadelphia on the penultimate drive of regulation, and the game remained at a stalemate in overtime, but reports on Burrow should be positive despite his team standing at 0-2-1 through three weeks. He'll next face a Jaguars defense that has surrendered six passing TDs over its past two outings.",

The 36-year-old has thrown nine touchdowns while committing no turnovers through the first three games of the season. His 8.4 yards per attempt is the highest it has been since his 2014 MVP campaign. Injuries and Father Time seemed to have Rodgers on a gradual decline over the past few seasons, but the future Hall of Famer looks healthy and comfortable in his second season under Matt LaFleur. Consider Rodgers a premium fantasy option heading into a favorable Week 4 matchup against Atlanta next Monday, especially if Davante Adams (hamstring) is able to return to action.",

    "report": "Watson completed 19 of 27 passes for 264 yards, two touchdowns and an interception in Sunday's 28-21 loss to the Steelers. He also ran once for five yardsWatson was quite efficient yet again, spreading the ball out to eight different pass catchers and recording 9.8 yards per attempt. However, the offense stalled out in the second half, as it went three-and-out on three of four drives while Watson attempted just nine passes. Watson now has thrown a pick and been sacked at least four times in each of the first three games, but he's also surpassed the 250-yard mark in each contest as well. The Texans are off to the dreaded 0-3 start and will need to dominate from here on out to have a chance at the playoffs. They'll look to turn their season around in Week 4 against the winless Vikings.",

He also rushed nine times for 83 yards, but lost one of his two fumbles.Jackson and the Ravens' high-flying offense was grounded in uncharacteristic fashion in Monday's much-anticipated tussle. Whereas opposing quarterback Patrick Mahomes totaled over 400 yards and five touchdowns, Jackson failed to even top 100 passing yards. Along with that career low, Jackson also needed until the fourth quarter to score Baltimore's first offensive touchdown, a five-yard pass to tight end Nick Boyle. If there was any silver lining, Jackson at least had a big game running the ball, setting a new season high while topping 75 rushing yards for the 13th time of his career. Nonetheless, after falling flat in Monday's matchup, Jackson will undoubtedly be eager to return to his MVP best in Week 4 versus Washington.",

He also rushed seven times for 38 yards and another score and logged one reception for no gain.In the team's Week 2 loss to the Bills, Fitzpatrick went a long way toward resembling the quarterback who knows coordinator Chan Gailey's offense well from having run it with ample success in both Buffalo and New York. Thursday, game script didn't call for Fitzpatrick to be anywhere near as active through the air, but the efficiency he demonstrated was that of a quarterback completely comfortable within a system. The veteran connected on his first 12 passes, a career best, and finished with a 133.3 rating for the night, misfiring only twice while averaging 8.0 yards per attempt and notching completions to seven different pass catchers. With the air attack now seemingly considerably ahead of where it was just two weeks ago in the opener against the Patriots, Fitzpatrick and his teammates will utilize some much-needed extra time to gear up for a formidable Week 4 interconference challenge in the form of the visiting Seahawks on Sunday, Oct. 4.",

    "headlineNews": "Seahawks' Russell Wilson: Makes history in shootout win",
    "report": "Wilson completed 27 of 40 passes for 315 yards and five touchdowns during Sunday's 38-31 win over the Cowboys. He added 22 rushing yards on six carries.Incredibly, he could have had a sixth TD, but DK Metcalf thought he could coast into the end zone on a 62-yard catch-and-run and had the ball knocked out of his hands from behind, resulting in a touchback. Wilson is now the first quarterback in NFL history to throw for at least four touchdowns in each of the first three games of a season, and his 14 passing TDs during that stretch also breaks the NFL record of 13 set by Patrick Mahomes two years ago. Wilson will head to Miami in Week 4 to take on a Dolphins defense that's already been lit up by Josh Allen this season.",

He also carried five times for 29 yards and a touchdown in the 26-23 loss.Murray completed 66 percent of his passes, but two interceptions on his opening three drives put his team in an early hole. He completed a pair of touchdowns to Andy Isabella and scored his fourth rushing touchdown in three games, but it ultimately wasn't enough to win after his early struggles. Murray had been excellent as both a passer and a runner in the first two games of the season and will look to get back on track next Sunday against the Panthers.",

He also rushed four times for eight yards and a touchdown, in addition to losing a fumble.Allen found Lee Smith for a one-yard touchdown on fourth down to open the scoring, then took it himself from one yard out on the next drive before adding a three-yard score to Tyler Kroft to take a 21-3 lead into the locker room at halftime. He hit Stefon Diggs for a four-yard touchdown to take a seemingly insurmountable 28-3 lead in the third quarter, but Los Angeles scored the next 29 points before Allen led a late touchdown drive capped by another three-yard touchdown to Kroft. All told, Allen has led the Bills to a 3-0 record with 12 total touchdowns compared to four turnovers heading into a Week 4 trip to Las Vegas.",

He also rushed twice for 10 yards and lost two fumbles.Carr couldn't get anything going for most of the first half until taking over with 34 seconds left in the second quarter and proceeding to lead a five-play touchdown drive capped with a one-yard score to Foster Moreau. Vegas moved the ball better in the second half, but Carr couldn't find the end zone until hooking up with Hunter Renfrow from 13 yards out to complete the scoring. While Carr has a tidy 74.0 completion percentage and 6:0 TD:INT through three weeks, there are major question marks about his supporting cast for Week 4 against the Bills. Running back Josh Jacobs (hip) and tight end Darren Waller (knee) played through injuries in this one, while wide receiver Henry Ruggs (knee/ankle) missed this game and fellow rookie wideout Bryan Edwards exited with an ankle injury.",

    "report": "Mullens completed 25 of 36 passes for 343 yards with one touchdown and no interceptions in the 49ers' 36-9 win over the Giants on Sunday. He also netted zero yards on four rushes.Stepping in for Jimmy Garoppolo (ankle), Mullens apparently drew upon his prior starting experience in his teammate's stead back in 2018 to put together an outstanding performance. The third-year signal-caller showed an excellent command of coach Kyle Shanahan's offense by connecting with 10 different pass catchers, with rookie receiver Brandon Aiyuk leading the way with a 5-70-0 line. Garoppolo may be ready to return for a Sunday night Week 4 battle against the Eagles, but Mullens' caliber of performance Week 3 certainly gives the coaching staff confidence he can step in and perform if called upon again.",

After posting a 67.8 percent completion rate Weeks 1 and 2, the 2016 MVP hit on just half of his throws during Week 3 -- tied for his lowest completion percentage in a game since Atlanta's 2018 season opener. Ryan still has potential to put up gaudy numbers moving forward despite an off day against the Bears, as he's thrown an astronomical 42.7 pass attempts per game through three appearances this season. He'll face a Packers defense Week 4 that ranks among the bottom 10 teams in the NFL with 8.0 yards allowed per pass attempt.",

He also rushed nine times for 27 yards.Newton's 11-yard touchdown pass to Rex Burkhead with 34 seconds left in the second quarter gave New England a 13-3 lead, but the advantage shrank to 13-10 by halftime. New England's ground game took over in the second half, but Newton wasn't a major part of it, as Sony Michel led the way with 117 rushing yards while Burkhead added two rushing touchdowns to his receiving score. While this was a disappointing step back for Newton after a pair of strong fantasy efforts to open his Patriots tenure, the dual-threat quarterback will need to shoulder a greater load in Week 4 for New England to keep up with the high-octane Chiefs offense.",

    "headlineNews": "Buccaneers' Tom Brady: Best game yet as Buc",
    "report": "Brady completed 25 of 38 passes for 297 yards with three touchdowns and no interceptions in the Buccaneers' 28-10 win over the Broncos on Sunday. He also netted zero yards on five rushes and had one fumble, but it was recovered by the offense.Brady unsurprisingly appears to be getting more comfortable in coach Bruce Arians' offense with each passing week, with Sunday's performance his most efficient yet in his three-game Buccaneers tenure. The future Hall of Famer continued to display excellent chemistry with MIke Evans near the goal line, hitting the Pro Bowl receiver for a pair of one-yard touchdown tosses. He also found Chris Godwin (hamstring), who'd missed Week 2 with a concussion, for another score, and he connected most often with Rob Gronkowski, hitting his long-time tight end on six occasions. All told, it was a comfortable win for the now 2-1 Bucs, who will look to stay hot in a Week 4 home battle against the Chargers.",

He turned it on after Buffalo stretched its lead to 28-3 in the third quarter, scoring on a one-yard keeper before hitting Robert Woods and Cooper Kupp for touchdowns of 25 and 16 yards, respectively. The latter was followed by a two-point conversion to Tyler Higbee, and the Rams pulled ahead 32-28 when Darrell Henderson capped a fourth consecutive touchdown drive with a one-yard run. Unfortunately for Los Angeles, the Bills responded with a game-winning touchdown drive of their own, but Goff will carry plenty of momentum into a Week 4 home date with the winless Giants.",

    "report": "Head coach Adam Gase said Monday that Darnold won't be benched following the Jets' 0-3 start to the season, Rich Cimini of ESPN.com reports. \"He just needs to keep playing,\" Gase said of the quarterback. \"He needs to keep playing and keep fixing the mistakes that are made and really emphasize the things he's doing really well, and just keep building on those.\"Darnold has had a rough start to his third NFL season, with his 29.0 QBR placing him ahead of only Washington's Dwayne Haskins (28.4) among qualified quarterbacks. He had an especially rough showing in the Jets' 36-7 loss to Colts on Sunday, when he threw three interceptions and had two of them returned for touchdowns. A lack of healthy, experienced pass catchers and poor offensive line play undoubtedly contributed to Darnold's struggles, so the Jets will give the 23-year-old some more time to try and right the ship and make the case that he's the franchise's long-term answer under center. Darnold at least draws his most favorable matchup of the season to date Thursday, with the Jets hosting a winless Broncos squad that will turn to backup options Jeff Driskel or Brett Rypien for a start while top quarterback Drew Lock (shoulder) misses a second straight game.",

He also carried two times for 12 yards in the 21-16 win.Bridgewater completed an impressive 79 percent of his passes while averaging a healthy 8.4 yards per attempt. He connected with Mike Davis for a 13-yard touchdown in the second quarter, doubling his season touchdown output, but it proved to be his only score of the day. Bridgewater's yardage and completion numbers have been quite strong through three games, but his fantasy value has suffered because of a lack of touchdowns. He'll look to buck that trend next Sunday against the Cardinals.",

    "report": "Minshew completed 30 of 42 passes for 275 yards with no touchdowns and one interception in the Jaguars' 31-13 loss to the Dolphins on Thursday. He also rushed three times for 22 yards and lost a fumble.Minshew had one of the better stat lines you'll see for a quarterback on the wrong end of an 18-point decision. The second-year gunslinger once again displayed above-average accuracy while averaging 6.5 yards per attempt, but he found himself frequently under duress while taking four sacks and 10 hits overall. Minshew's first turnover, a third-quarter fumble at his own seven, was particularly costly and came on one of those sacks, while the second occurred late in the contest with Jacksonville trying to tack on a meaningless touchdown. Despite Thursday's so-so fantasy effort, Minshew does still sport solid numbers in that regard through his first three games, as he owns a 6:2 TD:INT and has quickly amassed 787 passing yards. He and his teammates will look to regroup ahead of a favorable Week 4 road matchup against the Bengals on Sunday. Oct. 4.",

    "report": "Cousins completed 16 of his 27 pass attempts for 251 yards, three touchdowns and two interceptions in Week 3 against Tennessee.Cousins bounced back from an abysmal Week 2 performance for his first three-touchdown effort of the 2020 season. The highlight came on a 71-yard deep throw to rookie Justin Jefferson midway through the second quarter to give the Vikings a 24-12 lead. However, Cousins didn't play mistake-free as he threw two interceptions in the second half -- one on the team's first drive of the third quarter and another as the team was attempting to move down the field for the winning score late in the final quarter. Cousins and the Vikings' passing attack should be in a position to succeed in a Week 4 matchup against the Texans.",

He also lost a fumble.As his final numbers indicate, Jones' day through the air was extremely pedestrian, even while facing a considerably short-handed 49ers defense. The second-year signal-caller naturally seemed to be affected by the absence of both Saquon Barkley (knee) and Sterling Shepard (toe), and although he connected with eight pass catchers, none managed to garner more than five receptions (Golden Tate) or 53 receiving yards (Darius Slayton). Through three games, Jones has seen his completion percentage drop with each contest, and he's now gone back-to-back games without throwing a touchdown pass. The Duke product will look to bounce back in a tough Week 4 road matchup versus the Rams, but without Barkley and Shepard, he'll continue to operate with a truncated arsenal of offensive weapons.",

Despite that, the performance is encouraging for the Browns offense as a whole as Mayfield has completed 70 percent of his passes with four touchdowns and an interception since a Week 1 debacle against Baltimore.

    "headlineNews": "Eagles' Carson Wentz: Won't be benched",
    "report": "Coach Doug Pederson said it would be a \"knee jerk-reaction\" to bench Wentz in favor of Jalen Hurts, Jeff McLane of The Philadelphia Inquirer reports.The terminology is debatable, considering the Eagles now have a three-game sample of Wentz putting up poor numbers while the team struggles to score points. Of course, injuries to the offensive line and core group of skill-position players have been a big factor, with seven projected starters on offense missing time at some point this year. The Eagles won't bench Wentz before a Week 4 matchup with the similarly injury-marred 49ers, but it could become a discussion later in the season if his struggles continue and the team falls out of playoff contention. For fantasy purposes, Wentz has kept his head (barely) above water with rushing touchdowns in back-to-back games and an average of 44 pass attempts per week.",

    "report": "Herbert completed 35 of 49 passes for 330 yards and a touchdown along with an interception in the 21-16 loss Sunday to the Panthers. He also lost a fumble.Herbert was strip sacked on the team's second possession, setting up an uphill battle all afternoon for the rookie. Herbert looked poised throughout most of the contest, and he rebounded from an erratic first half to help the Chargers make a last ditch come-from-behind  drive that could have been successful if Austin Ekeler hadn't botched a hook-and-ladder attempt that would have scored the game-winning touchdown. Keenan Allen and Hunter Henry were Herbert's primary targets in the middle of the field as the duo accounted for 30 of his 49 attempts, but Austin Ekeler also amounted to a built-in confidence booster with a number of designed screens and flare outs helping pile up the yardage. Herbert was briefly forced from the game after taking a shot to the ribs, per Daniel Popper of The Athletic, but the rookie avoided a serious injury and promptly came back in. It seems likely Herbert will start again in Week 4 as ESPN's Adam Schefter reported earlier in the day Tyrod Taylor (chest) likely won't gain clearance to play after his lung was punctured from a pain-killing injection last week.",

He also had a would-be score that was dropped, and yet another touchdown that was overturned by replay. Coming off the efficient comeback performance, it's not surprising to see Foles named the starter for Week 4, but it remains to be seen how long of a leash he'll have if Indianapolis' potent defense causes the Bears to struggle on offense.",

Still, his production was enough to move him up the all-time rankings in a number of categories: he's the sixth QB in league history with 400 touchdown passes, the sixth with over 60,000 passing yards, and he passed Dan Marino for fifth in career completions, needing only 20 more to reach 5,000. Rivers  should face a much tougher test in Week 4 on the road against a Bears defense that just shut Matt Ryan down in the second half of their comeback win in Atlanta.",

Rypien made his NFL debut in Week 3's loss to the Buccaneers after Jeff Driskel couldn't produce, and he looked serviceable, completing his first eight passing attempts for 53 yards before tossing an interception. Fangio did relay that Driskel could still be used in the offense, according to James Palmer of NFL Network, but Rypien will get the first chance against a Jets defense that ranks 15th with 239 passing yards allowed per game.",

However, it's not as disappointing as a glance at the stat line would suggest, as this is the same defensive front that held Giants RB Saquon Barkley (knee) to just six yards on 15 carries in the season opener. Johnson still managed to reel in a pair of catches and a touchdown in the second quarter to provide some relief for fantasy managers. He'll look to get back on track in Week 4 against the Vikings, who have allowed a 100-yard rusher in back-to-back games.",

    "report": "Kamara rushed just six times for 58 yards, but corralled 13 receptions (14 targets) for 139 yards and two touchdowns in Sunday's 37-30 loss to the Packers.Kamara did his best Michael Thomas (ankle) impression with his teammate forced to sit this one out due to injury. The dynamic back did most of his damage after the catch, including a 52-yard touchdown scamper in which he broke four tackles after receiving the ball near the line of scrimmage. After a down year slowed by injury in 2019, Kamara is looking more like the top-five fantasy player we saw in his first two seasons in the NFL. The 25-year-old became just the second player in NFL history to rush for three touchdowns and catch three touchdown passes through his team's first three games (per ESPN). There is a chance that Thomas returns for Week 4's matchup against the Lions, but if he is forced to sit out, Kamara should be in line to post WR1 numbers again after averaging 11.5 receptions and 117 receiving yards in the two games sans Thomas.",

He slipped in the end zone and gave up a safety just before his own score, and he dropped numerous catchable passes from Dak Prescott. Elliott will look to bounce back in Week 4 against a Browns defense that just gave up 5.4 yards a carry and a rushing touchdown to rookie Antonio Gibson.",

The 25-year-old has been a touchdown machine early in the season, rushing for four and adding a fifth through the air through three contests. Jones has proven that he can stay involved even in contests that turn into shootouts, which next Monday's matchup against the Falcons has the potential of becoming.",

Despite the absence of Christian Kirk and the fact that the Cardinals were trailing for much of the game, he curiously wasn't used much as a pass catcher and has now drawn just five targets through three games this season. Drake also failed to reach the end zone again and has one touchdown to his name. He still carries plenty of fantasy upside given his current role and will look to break out next Sunday in a favorable matchup against the Panthers.",

Yeldon (three carries for 18 yards) was the only other running back to touch the ball for the Bills. Singletary failed to get into the end zone on a direct snap from the one-yard line in the first quarter and ended up watching quarterback Josh Allen account for five touchdowns from inside the five-yard line, but Singletary's 121 scrimmage yards were eight shy of his combined total from Weeks 1 and 2. While his lack of usage in the red zone puts a cap on Singletary's value, he should be a reliable source of yardage against the Raiders in Week 4.",

    "report": "Gurley registered 80 rushing yards and a touchdown on 14 carries, also catching one of his two targets for two receiving yards during Sunday's 30-26 loss to the Bears.The two-time All-Pro back enjoyed an efficient afternoon on the ground, as his 5.7 yards-per-carry average against the Bears marks his best since Week 10 of last season. Gurley punched in a 10-yard TD run at the 12:34 mark of the third quarter to provide Atlanta with a two-possession lead, but for a second straight week, the Falcons blew a second-half lead of at least 16 points. He has just three total receiving yards through three games, but a workload of 16.3 rush attempts per game is enough to retain Gurley as a strong fantasy play heading into a Week 4 matchup against the Packers. Coming into the weekend, Green Bay ranked among the NFL's 10 worst defenses with 4.9 yards per carry allowed to opposing running backs.",

    "report": "Mixon registered 49 rushing yards on 17 carries, adding two catches for 16 yards during Sunday's 23-23 tie against Philadelphia.The former Oklahoma Sooner has been bestowed a typically heavy workload through the first three weeks of 2020, racking up 19.7 offensive touches per game. That usage hasn't translated into rampant production in the early going. Most of Mixon's work has come via the ground, of course, where he is averaging fewer than 3.2 yards per carry behind an offensive line that is without starting right tackle Xavier Su'a-Filo (ankle). Mixon also remains without a touchdown on the year, further reducing his fantasy value. In 2019, Mixon started slowly before heating up late in the season, as he had collected just 87 rushing yards (on 32 attempts) through three outings, only to chalk up three rushing outings of 135-plus yards Weeks 14 through 17. Mixon's upcoming matchup doesn't indicate a likely breakout, however, as the Jaguars have allowed three total touchdowns and a mere 3.2 yards per rush to opposing RBs in 2020.",

Although he averaged just 3.2 yards per carry, the rookie flashed his ability to make defenders miss through power and quickness, and he reached 20 carries for the second time in three games. More impressively, however, Edwards-Helaire displayed his excellent hands, setting a new high mark in receiving yards for his young career. Just three games into life as a pro, Edwards-Helaire has already established himself as a uniquely talented tailback who's perfectly suited for his role in Kansas City's scheme, keeping his stock high ahead of a clash with the Patriots in Week 4.",

His one-yard touchdown with 4:30 left completed Los Angeles' remarkable turnaround from down 28-3 to up 32-28, but Buffalo responded with a game-winning touchdown drive aided by a controversial fourth-down pass interference penalty. While it remains to be seen whether Henderson dominates touches as heavily once Akers returns, he seems to have established himself as the main man in Los Angeles' backfield over the past two weeks. Up next is an appealing Week 4 home game against the Giants.",

    "headlineNews": "Giants' Devonta Freeman: Should be busier Week 4",
    "report": "Head coach Joe Judge said Freeman's role should increase this week, though the Giants still want to use a three-man rotation at running back, Jordan Raanan of ESPN.com reports.Freeman led the team with five carries in Sunday's 36-9 loss to the 49ers, but he didn't draw any targets and played fewer snaps (29 percent) than both Dion Lewis (38 percent) and Wayne Gallman (35 percent). While it sounds like the split will shift more toward Freeman as he improves his knowledge of the playbook, he still appears to be part of a committee in a struggling offense, hardly the ideal situation for fantasy production. His Week 4 opponent has allowed 4.8 yards per carry this season, but Freeman may not have much change to take advantage, as the Giants are massive underdogs in a road game against the 2-1 Rams.",

There was nothing spectacular about Jones' day -- he had a long run of 13 yards on his way to 4.1 yards per rush -- but the USC product encouragingly enjoyed a solid presence in the passing game as well. Through three games, Jones is now averaging 12.1 carries and three targets per contest, numbers that his fantasy managers hope will be exceeded in a Week 4 home matchup against the Chargers.",

It appears that was in an effort to keep Conner fresh, as he helped Pittsburgh control the game in the second half and scored the decisive touchdown on a 12-yard run in the fourth quarter. He now piled up 270 scrimmage yards and two touchdowns over his last two games and will look to keep up his excellent production next Sunday against the Titans.",

He added two receptions for 11 yards.Henry topped 100 yards for the second time in his first three games. However, he managed to find the end zone for the first time, punching in a pair of one-yard scores to play a major role in the Titans' narrow victory. While it's no surprise Henry has dominated rushing work out of the team's backfield, he also has five receptions early on this season and has recorded multiple receptions on two occasions. Though that doesn't place him  among the elite pass-catching running backs in the league, he recorded multiple receptions in only four games during the entire 2019 campaign.",

    "report": "Robinson rushed 11 times for 46 yards and two touchdowns and brought in all six targets for 83 yards in the Jaguars' 31-13 loss to the Dolphins on Thursday.Even in a surprisingly lopsided loss, Robinson found a way to stand out yet again. Not only did the undrafted rookie free agent account for both of the Jaguars' scores, he also checked in tops on the team in receptions and receiving yardage. While game script prevented the Illinois State product from seeing the 16-carry workload he enjoyed in the first two games, he's now upped his reception total over that of the previous contest in two straight contests. Given his robust usage and the Bengals' questionable run defense, Robinson's fantasy prospects are favorable for a Week 4 road battle against Cincinnati on Sunday, Oct. 4.",

    "report": "Ekeler carried the ball 12 times for 59 yards and also caught all 11 of his targets for 80 yards in Sunday's 21-16 loss to the Panthers. He also accounted for a touchdown.It should have been an even better day for Ekeler, but the running back botched a hook-and-ladder attempt which would have resulted in a walk-in, game-winning touchdown. After a Week 1 which saw the star back record just one target, the Chargers have made a concerted effort to include Ekeler in the passing game with 15 targets over the past two weeks. Most of that workload came Sunday with the team trailing from the jump, though the 11 targets weren't simply off of checkdowns or dump-offs but rather clearly designed screen plays and flare routes. It's fairly clear Ekeler will get the majority of the workload in the event the team is trailing, something that wasn't necessarily confirmed throughout the first two games with Joshua Kelley acting in tandem with Ekeler to begin the season. It might be a bit tougher to pile up the yards next week when the Chargers travel to face a Buccaneers defense that just held Melvin Gordon to under 3.2 yards per touch.",

    "headlineNews": "Lions' Adrian Peterson: Likely to retain lead role",
    "report": "Lions offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell suggested Tuesday that Peterson will continue to serve as Detroit's lead back, Michael Rothstein of ESPN.com reports. \"I don't know when it's going to happen, but [Peterson] wants [the ball], we want him to have it and we'll just keep continuing to go there and spell him with Kerryon [Johnson], spell him with [D'Andre] Swift and kind of go from there,\" Bevell said.After averaging 6.3 yards per carry through the Lions' first two games, Peterson saw his workload pick up in a major way in Sunday's 26-23 win over the Cardinals. With Detroit claiming an early lead, Peterson led a ground-heavy attack the rest of way, running 22 times for 75 yards and hauling in a 10-yard reception for a touchdown while playing 60 percent of the offensive snaps. Johnson and Swift will likely cut into Peterson's snaps when the Lions are forced to play from behind and pass more frequently, but look for the veteran to dominate the carries when Detroit is sitting on a lead. The Lions may not have that luxury Week 4, as they'll enter Sunday's matchup with the Saints as home underdogs.",

He also added three catches for 11 yards.Gibson found the end zone for the second consecutive game, converting a two-yard score to cap off a third-quarter drive. While that helped him to a productive day, he also broke off rushes of 13 and nine yards. The only downside to his performance was a lost fumble to end the first half, though the mistake did not have a major impact on the outcome of the game. While Gibson still saw only nine of the 22 carries out of Washington's backfield, it seems to be only a matter of time before  he emerges as the top option for the team.",

Meanwhile, the reserve RB combo of Boston Scott and Corey Clement has combined for 13 touches during that stretch. With another injury to his glute in tow, Sanders nonetheless was able to get in some work Wednesday. He'll look to increase his activity level as the week continues.",

With Jeff Driskel stepping in as the starting quarterback against Tampa Bay, Gordon got out to a sluggish start with seven yards on his four first-quarter rush attempts. From there, game flow largely mitigated Gordon's usage as Denver fell into a 17-3 hole at the 6:35 mark of the second quarter. Things may be looking up for Gordon heading into a Thursday night matchup against the Jets, however, as Gang Green has given up more than 4.6 yards per carry to opposing RBs in 2020.",

    "report": "Ingram rushed seven times for 30 yards in Monday night's 34-20 loss to the Chiefs.Ingram was also targeted once but failed to connect with quarterback Lamar Jackson. On a night when Baltimore trailed for the majority of the contest, the team's patented ground game never got into gear. Jackson led the Ravens with 83 rushing yards, but no tailback topped 40 yards or garnered more than Ingram's seven carries. That being said, through three games, Ingram has totaled just 136 yards while scoring once, so Monday's performance actually resembles his average outing to date. While the small sample size is surely something to consider, the presence of rookie J.K. Dobbins, whose 38 receiving yards paced all Baltimore pass-catchers, along with holdover Gus Edwards has resulted in Ingram being leaned on less. Fortunately for him, a Week 4 matchup against Washington bodes well for a Ravens rebound.",

Things don't get much easier with the undefeated Bills coming to town in Week 4, though Buffalo did allow over 100 rushing yards to Rams running back Darrell Henderson on Sunday.",

He also scored a beautiful 13-yard receiving touchdown in which he weaved through multiple defenders en route to the end zone. Davis assumed a large share of the backfield touches in the absence of Christian McCaffrey (ankle), and although his production won't mirror that of his teammate, he proved he can contribute respectably in that role. He will have another shot to do so next Sunday against the Cardinals.",

    "headlineNews": "Dolphins' Myles Gaskin: Lead-back duties in win",
    "report": "Gaskin rushed 22 times for 66 yards and brought in all five targets for 29 yards in the Dolphins' 31-13 win over the Jaguars on Thursday.Through the Dolphins' first two games, the backfield wealth was essentially spread amongst Gaskin, Matt Breida and Jordan Howard, with no clear-cut lead back. That clearly changed for at least one game Thursday, as Gaskin outpaced his aforementioned teammates by 19 carries each and also co-led the team in both receptions and targets. The second-year back wasn't anywhere near as efficient on the ground as during the first two games of the season, when he averaged 5.4 yards on his 16 rushes. However, the boost in volume on the ground was certainly a welcome sight for Gaskin's fantasy managers, who now have reason to hope the Washington product could be headed for a true workhorse role moving forward that also includes a solid pass-catching component. Gaskin will look to make good on that potential in a Week 4 home date against the Seahawks on Sunday, Oct. 4.",

Michel rushed nine times for 117 yards and caught both of his targets for another 23 yards in this past Sunday's 36-20 win over the Raiders. It was an encouraging performance no doubt, but weekly volume figures an issue for any member of New England's backfield.",

The 30-year-old Hyde underwent surgery this offseason to repair a torn labrum in his shoulder, and while it's unclear if his current injury is related, it's worth keeping an eye on. Keep in mind that Carson was able to log a limited practice session Wednesday, though, and coach Pete Carroll believes he has a chance to play Sunday. However, if both running backs sit out, Travis Homer will lead the backfield with rookie DeeJay Dallas rotating in.",

    "report": "Bernard corralled all three of his targets for a total of 55 receiving yards during Sunday's 23-23 tie against the Eagles.The 28-year-old back went without a rush attempt, as Joe Mixon handled all 17 RB carries for Cincinnati while running to a 2.9 yard-per-attempt average. It appears that may be the trend going forward, as Bernard has been targeted 15 times through three games with only two rush attempts. Last year his usage was much more balanced, with Bernard garnering 53 rushes to 43 targets across his 16 appearances. Based on the way he's currently being deployed, Week 4 offers a promising matchup given that the Jaguars have surrendered the fifth-most RB receptions (22) thus far in 2020.",

    "report": "Hunt was held out of Wednesday's practice with a groin injury, Mary Kay Cabot of The Cleveland Plain Dealer reports.Hunt didn't show any sign of injury in Sunday's 34-20 win over Washington, once again serving as the Browns' fourth-quarter closer after Nick Chubb piled up stats throughout most of the game. If the groin injury were to threaten Hunt's status for Week 4 at Dallas, the Browns might turn to Chubb for a three-down role, or else they could use D'Ernest Johnson or Dontrell Hilliard to take on some of the vacated workload. Hilliard was promoted from the practice squad to the active roster Wednesday, which hints at some level of concern about Hunt's availability Sunday. For what it's worth, head coach Kevin Stefanski said the running back is merely day-to-day, according to Scott Petrak of the Elyria Chronicle-Telegram.",

    "report": "Brown rushed seven times for 19 yards and came up empty on two targets in Sunday's 35-32 loss to Buffalo.Brown was outplayed by Darrell Henderson, who rushed 20 times for 114 yards and a touchdown. While neither back made much of an impact in the passing game, Henderson's the more polished receiver and thus took on a larger role with the Rams digging out of a 28-3 hole. Now that he seems to have fallen behind Henderson in the pecking order, volume could be an issue for Brown against the Giants in Week 4, especially if Cam Akers (ribs) is able to make his return.",

Still, the rookie's third-quarter TD salvaged his day from a fantasy perspective. Assuming it's a more competitive contest, Taylor could be more involved, and more productive, in Week 4 against a Bears defense that just gave up 148 rushing yards and two TDs to the Atlanta backfield.",

    "report": "Hill ran for 58 yards and a touchdown on nine carries, also hauling in one of three targets for 22 receiving yards during Sunday's 30-26 loss to the Bears.Hill was repeatedly referred to as one of the breakouts of Falcons training camp this summer, but he mustered only 10 combined offensive touches for 45 scrimmage yards Weeks 1 and 2. The 24-year-old was clearly more integral to the game plan this time around, as Hill's 10 touches marked his highest total since he last started at running back Week 12 of last season. Additionally, the fact that Ito Smith and Qadree Ollison were both active against Chicago indicates that Hill's increased usage may be a recurring trend going forward. Atlanta's Week 4 opponent, Green Bay, entered Sunday tied for the fourth-most rushing TDs allowed to opposing running backs (three), meaning that Hill has a reasonable chance of reaching the end zone for a second straight game.",

    "headlineNews": "Lions' Kerryon Johnson: Loses starting job",
    "report": "Johnson rushed three times for 16 yards while securing his only target for 14 yards during Sunday's 26-23 victory over Arizona.Johnson lost starting duties to Adrian Peterson and ultimately saw just 20 offensive snaps compared to Peterson's 40 and D'Andre Swift's six. After the game, head coach Matt Patricia indicated that controlling the clock was one of Detroit's primary objectives, according to Chris Burke of the Athletic, which may explain why the backfield playing time was as divided as it was. Perhaps we should expect similar distributions when Detroit matches up with other fast-paced teams like the Cardinals, who rank top five in the league in total offensive snaps. However, barring an injury to Peterson or Swift, Johnson currently doesn't seem like a great bet for consistent offensive touches in any scenario.",

In the event that Broncos elect to hold Lindsay out for another game with an eye toward having him at or near 100 percent for the team's Oct. 11 game against the Patriots, Melvin Gordon would continue to log the bulk of the team's snaps and touches out of the backfield. Meanwhile, Royce Freeman would handle change-of-pace duties behind Gordon.",

While Sony Michel (nine carries for 117 yards) was the leading rusher and J.J. Taylor led the team with 11 carries (for 43 yards), Burkhead was the most opportunistic running back, with rushing scores of five and two yards in the second half. The Patriots will distribute touches out of the backfield between a few guys every week, but at least until White returns, Burkhead has the highest floor thanks to his pass-catching ability. Game script should favor Burkhead and the rest of New England's pass catchers in Week 4 against the Chiefs.",

Against a Cardinals team that ran a hefty 159 total offensive snaps during the first two weeks of the season, Lions head coach Matt Patricia suggested after the game that the backfield playing time was determined by Detroit's goal to \"control the clock,\" according to Chris Burke of the Athletic. As it appears Swift is neither Detroit's first or second option when they want to do so, the rookie may be hard to trust in games when the Lions are expected to try to dominate the time of possession.",

He did not record a carry.The veteran back wasn't used in the running game for the second time in the first three weeks, although he did manage to record multiple receptions for the second straight contest. McCoy seems to be entrenched in a low-volume pass-catching role that won't have much fantasy utility outside of the deepest of PPR formats, at least as long as Ronald Jones and Leonard Fournette remain healthy.",

The playing time clearly is there for Thompson as he's played 31 and 30 offensive snaps the past two weeks, but his 65 scrimmage yards on 12 touches better illustrates his involvement in the offense. The 29-year-old is seeing plenty of snaps in the passing-down role, but to this point Robinson is the only back on the team providing much production.",

He also rushed twice for 25 yards.Hill started the game by taking an end-around 22 yards on Kansas City's first offensive snap. The speedster subsequently made a catch of 33 yards, setting up his team's opening score, then got in the end zone himself with a 20-yard, over-the-shoulder reception in the second quarter. In doing so, Hill continued his touchdown streak, having scored in each of the first three weeks this season, and also topped 100 total yards for the second straight game. On the back of form like that, Hill should be anxious to keep his momentum going in Week 4 versus the Patriots.",

Beckham has 22 targets through three games compared to the 30 he had after three games in 2019. That will be the nature of the offense, which will rely on the ground game when it can dictate the terms of a game. That means fewer opportunities for Beckham, who has learned to accept the new offense and adjusted his goals accordingly, per an earlier report from Cabot of the Cleveland Plain Dealer.",

    "headlineNews": "Falcons' Julio Jones: Sidelined Week 3",
    "report": "Jones (hamstring) is inactive for Sunday's game against the Bears.Though Jones failed to practice all week, the Falcons still viewed him as a game-day decision heading into Sunday. The star wideout's strained hamstring ultimately proved too limiting in his pregame workout for him to give it a go, depriving the 0-2 Falcons of one of their top playmakers on the outside. Either Christian Blake or Olamide Zaccheaus will likely replace Jones in three-wide sets, but expect the trio of Calvin Ridley, Russell Gage and Hayden Hurst to dominate the targets in the passing game.",

The 27-year-old has been able to carry over his 2019 rapport with quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick into this season despite the limited practice time in a new offense, as he's now brought in 14 of 17 targets for 169 yards and a touchdown through three games. Parker will now have a chance to get his legs some extra rest ahead of a Week 4 home matchup against the Seahawks on Sunday, Oct. 4.",

He scored a 26-yard touchdown on busted coverage from the Houston defense in the second quarter, salvaging what would have been a more disappointing day from a fantasy perspective. Smith-Schuster's yardage totals have been lackluster the last two weeks, but he could buck that trend next Sunday against a porous Titans defense, and especially if Diontae Johnson (concussion) is forced to sit out.",

There was no indication that he was hindered, so his sudden appearance on the injury report is surprising, to say the least. No matter, he's been something of an ironman throughout his eight-year career, with two DNPs during that span. Hopkins' status will be one to monitor closely as the week goes on.",

With its No. 1 wide receiver on the pine, Green Bay seems poised to use more 12 personnel than normal with just two viable WR (Allen Lazard and Marquez Valdes-Scantling) available to the offense. That said, Malik Taylor and Darrius Shepherd are active if and when coach Matt LaFleur dials up three-wide sets.",

However, Thielen tallied a score of his own, recording a 16-yard touchdown in the corner of the end zone in the middle of the second quarter. That covered over an otherwise subpar performance, and Thielen has now recorded 60 yards combined in his past two games. He'll look to bounce back in a positive matchup against the Texans in Week 4.",

He also registered seven yards on his lone rush attempt.As Julio Jones sat with a left hamstring strain, Ridley dominated the target share, attracting more than double the targets of Atlanta's No. 2 option, Olamide Zaccheaus (six). Had the third-year receiver been able to register a touchdown Sunday, he would have joined Randy Moss, Marvin Harrison, Jerry Rice and Dwight Clark as the only players in NFL history to start a season with three straight 100-yard, one-TD games. Safe to say, Ridley is red-hot heading into a Week 4 matchup against a Packers defense that surrendered the second-most receiving TDs to opposing wideouts Weeks 1 and 2.",

Since then, he's been focusing on rehab and even looked good in a workout last Friday. Still, Thomas has two more days to prove the health of his ankle once and for all with a full showing, before the Saints decide on his status for Sunday's game against the Lions.",

He didn't break off many big gains but did make an excellent leaping catch for a touchdown just before halftime. Most importantly, Golladay seemingly emerged from the game without aggravating the hamstring injury that cost him the first two games of the season. He could be primed for a big game next Sunday against the Saints.",

That news is comforting for those banking on a resurgence from Green over the course of the season, though it doesn't do much to remedy a series of mediocre fantasy performances through the first three weeks of 2020. The targets have been there for Green in the early going (28), though he's totaled 116 receiving yards and zero touchdowns with those opportunities. The veteran wideout will now face a Jacksonville defense that surrendered a 90 percent completion rate and two passing touchdowns to Miami on Thursday night.",

    "headlineNews": "Texans' Will Fuller: First TD of 2019",
    "report": "Fuller caught four of five targets for 54 yards and a touchdown in Sunday's 28-21 loss to the Steelers.After receiving zero targets in Week 2's loss to the Ravens, Fuller bounced back and garnered a team-high five targets, hauling one in for a 14-yard touchdown late in the first half. Fuller and Randall Cobb both accounted for touchdowns Sunday to become the first Texans wide receivers to score this season. It appears Fuller is past the hamstring injury that hampered him in Week 2, so while he's still a bit boom-or-bust, he should be dependable as long as he stays healthy. The Texans have an intriguing Week 4 matchup on tap against the Vikings, which have let up an average of 299.3 passing yards per game this season.",

Cooper is still looking for his first TD of the year, but given how explosive the Dallas passing game has been it should only be a matter of time, and his 25 catches for 267 yards through three games is a nice consolation prize. Cooper could be primed to hit pay dirt in Week 4 against a Browns defense that's already given up five touchdowns to opposing WRs.",

The Colorado State product has struggled to make an impact in new coordinator Chan Gailey's offense thus far, posting just five catches on 14 targets through three games. The solid amount of looks is encouraging, and Williams may be able to start converting them into better production the more he familiarizes himself with the scheme. He'll look to push his numbers up across the board in a Week 4 home matchup against the Seahawks on Sunday, Oct. 4.",

In addition to his score, he was ruled to have notched an additional touchdown, but replay overturned the call, keeping him from turning in a massive fantasy performance. For the third week in a row, he led the team in targets, and after logging nine looks in each of the first two games, he ended up with 13 passes thrown his way. Given his secure role and upside, Robinson is firmly entrenched as a high-floor top-15 wide receiver.",

He's also shown the ability to accrue plenty of volume as well, seeing no fewer than seven targets in any of Washington's three contests this season. Despite a largely inefficient offense, McLaurin has shown the ability to excel as Dwayne Haskins' top target. However, he'll face a stiff test in Week 4 as Washington takes on Baltimore.",

    "report": "Allen caught 13 of his 19 targets for 136 yards and a touchdown in the 21-16 loss to the Panthers on Sunday.There should be no doubt who Justin Herbert's favorite target is. Allen again proved to be invaluable for the rookie quarterback, routinely creating space with expert route running in the middle of the field. A myriad of crossing routes, which have been a staple in past years, were on full display as well, allowing for the savvy route runner to consistently find a way to get open. Allen and Hunter Henry were Herbert's primary focus, which unsurprisingly accounted for the majority of the targets in the middle of the field. The heavy target total probably isn't something that will be repeatable considering the Chargers trailed for the majority of the contest, but it's obvious Allen's stature as a fantasy mainstay has not changed with the rookie under center.",

The 24-year-old came through with flying colors, setting new career highs in receptions (six) and yards (146). It's unclear whether Adams will be able to return for next Monday's matchup against the Falcons, but Lazard had already secured the No. 2 wideout role in Green Bay, making him a strong fantasy play against a porous Falcons secondary even if the former is a go.",

Jeudy has been a go-to man for young quarterbacks Drew Lock (shoulder) and Jeff Driskel in the early going, as he's already amassed 24 targets across the first three weeks of 2020. Though he's yet to cash in with a touchdown in the NFL, Jeudy has been a high-floor option with four or more receptions and 55-plus receiving yards in each of his outings this year. In Week 4 he draws a matchup against a Jets defense that is allowing a 73.2 percent catch rate to opposing wideouts.",

After just one grab in an injury-shortened Week 2 outing, Watkins bounced back well with his performance Monday, giving him decent momentum ahead of Week 4's game versus the Patriots.",

Lockett could be poised for another big performance next week against a Dolphins defense that couldn't contain John Brown or Stefon Diggs in its Week 2 meeting with the Bills.",

After hauling in just two of his six targets for 23 yards this past Sunday, Edelman will look to bounce back this weekend in a game that could well feature a more pass-heavy New England attack versus 3-0 Kansas City.",

Cobb is behind Will Fuller and Brandin Cooks in the pecking order, but he has value in deeper fantasy leagues and should be an option in Week 4 against the Vikings, which have allowed 299.3 passing yards per game this season.",

Aiyuk had generated a modest 2-21-0 line back in his Week 2 debut, but if Nick Mullens is forced to log another start in place of Jimmy Garoppolo (ankle) in a Week 4 Sunday night matchup against the Eagles, the chemistry the duo demonstrated Week 3 provides reason for optimism from a fantasy perspective.",

Brown (knee). The majority of his production came on a 38-yard reception that ultimately set up a one-yard rushing score for Derrick Henry late in the third quarter. Davis may be heading toward a fourth-year breakout -- he has 206 yards and a touchdown across three games --  if Brown remains sidelined for future contests.",

The second-year speedster also fumbled on the 49ers' 19-yard line after a 22-yard reception just after the two-minute warning in the second half, but New York was completely out of the game by that point. Despite the underwhelming fantasy day Sunday, Slayton still figures to see an uptick in opportunity in coming weeks while Sterling Shepard (toe) remains sidelined. Slayton will look to up his production at the expense of the Rams in a Week 4 road battle.",

    "report": "Jones caught all three of his targets for 51 yards during Sunday's 26-23 win over the Cardinals.Jones finished fifth on the team in targets while ranking third in both receptions and receiving yards. He made the most of the looks he received, but his reduced role is a direct result of teammate Kenny Golladay making his season debut. Jones still has the ability to break off big plays when given the chance, but his boom-or-bust profile could result in plenty of down weeks as well. With Golladay drawing attention from the Saints defense next Sunday, perhaps Jones will find himself called into action a bit more frequently.",

The rookie wideout has looked good to begin his career, catching 16 of 21 targets for 230 yards and a TD through three games, and he'll try to add to those numbers Week 4 against a Browns defense that's already given up five touchdowns to opposing WRs.",

Tomlin said Johnson won't be able to clear the league's protocol until Friday at the earliest, so it's possible the second-year receiver will be able to play in Sunday's game versus the Titans. However, his practice capacity this week will be closely monitored. Chase Claypool and James Washington should both see an uptick in usage behind JuJu Smith-Schuster if Johnson sits out Sunday.",

    "report": "Kupp caught nine of 10 targets for 107 yards and a touchdown in Sunday's 35-32 loss to Buffalo.Kupp caught a 16-yard touchdown during Los Angeles' run of 29 unanswered points after falling behind 28-3. Unfortunately for the Rams, Buffalo responded with a game-winning touchdown drive aided by a controversial pass interference penalty to hand Los Angeles its first loss of the season. The slot receiver has totaled triple-digit scrimmage yards in consecutive games, and Kupp will have a great opportunity to stretch that streak to three in Week 4 against the Giants.",

Smith's deep-threat abilities have yet to make an appearance in 2020, as Brees has struggled to get the ball downfield. Despite his increase in targets while Michael Thomas (ankle) has been sidelined, Smith's value is capped by the Saints' highly conservative, if high-volume, pass attack.",

    "report": "Evans secured both of his targets for a pair of one-yard touchdowns in the Buccaneers' 28-10 win over the Broncos on Sunday.Evans was uncharacteristically quiet from a cumulative statistical standpoint, but the fact both his receptions went for touchdowns rewarded fantasy managers nevertheless. Evans' receiving yardage tally was naturally an outlier that is  unlikely to come close to repeating itself this season. Additionally, the 27-year-old already has four touchdowns on the campaign, and the level of trust that clearly already exists between him and Brady should continue to pay handsome fantasy dividends throughout the remainder of the campaign. Evans will look to continue finding the end zone while offering more production in  receptions and receiving yardage against the Chargers in a Week 4 battle, a game that Chris Godwin (hamstring) notably could miss after he exited Sunday's game early.",

    "report": "Metcalf caught four of eight targets for 110 yards and a touchdown in Sunday's 38-31 win over the Cowboys.He led the Seahawks in receiving yards on the day, but Metcalf should have had one more yard and one more TD -- on a 62-yard catch-and-run late in the first quarter, he thought he could coast into the end zone but instead got caught from behind and had the ball knocked out of his hands for a touchback. He made up for his gaffe in the fourth quarter, however, hauling in the game-winning score with less than two minutes left on the clock. The second-year wideout has recorded at least 90 yards and a touchdown in every game so far in 2020, and Metcalf will look to keep that streak going next week against a Dolphins defense that couldn't contain John Brown or Stefon Diggs in its Week 2 meeting with the Bills.",

The veteran has still only garnered eight targets over two games sans Michael Thomas (ankle), as running back Alvin Kamara (23 targets in that span) appears to have absorbed most of the injured star wideout's looks. Drew Brees will have to start taking more shots down the field in order to get his wideouts more involved (Brees currently owns a league-worst 4.61 average air yards per attempt). Thomas is hoping to return to the field against the Lions in Week 4, a development that would not do any favors for Sanders' target share.",

    "report": "Higgins caught five of his nine targets for 40 receiving yards and two touchdowns during Sunday's 23-23 tie against the Eagles.The No. 33 overall pick from April's draft was practically invisible in his NFL debut, playing 15 offensive snaps against the Chargers but garnering zero targets. His involvement increased drastically in Week 2 at Cleveland, as Higgins jumped to a workload of 60 offensive plays and hauled in three of his six targets for 35 yards. Week 3 marks his breakout and possible arrival as a fantasy stalwart alongside Joe Burrow, as Higgins corralled all three of his red-zone targets Sunday, with two leading to scores inside the five-yard line. Now Higgins and his rookie signal-caller will face a Jaguars defense Week 4 that allowed Ryan Fitzpatrick to establish a Dolphins franchise record in completing 90 percent of his pass attempts Thursday night.",

Green to Boyd as the Bengals' No. 1 wideout, as the 25-year-old has outproduced the seven-time Pro Bowler in amassing 230 receiving yards to Green's 116 through three weeks. Green garnered 22 targets to Boyd's 13 Weeks 1 and 2, but Joe Burrow threw to Boyd with more than twice the frequency than he did Green in Week 3 as Cincinnati avoided a loss for just the third time since the start of last season. Next for Boyd is a matchup against a Jacksonville defense that has already surrendered three wide receiver touchdowns in 2020.",

The Cardinals have yet to touch on the severity of Hopkins' concern, but it'll be something to watch as the week goes on due to the trickle-down effect it could have on the likes of Kirk. Still, Kirk may not be out of the woods himself as it pertains to his groin issue, which forced him to sit out Week 3 against the Lions.",

The veteran's had a quiet start to the year as he tries to build chemistry with Philip Rivers, but Hilton could be busier in Week 4 during a more competitive contest against a Bears defense that just allowed Calvin Ridley to haul in 110 yards.",

That contribution helped Samuel post his highest yardage total through three weeks, as he again was involved both in the air and on the ground. With Christian McCaffrey (ankle) sidelined, Samuel garnered four carries for the second game in a row, and although he struggled to get anything going from those touches, his eight overall trailed only replacement tailback Mike Davis' 21 among Carolina's skill-position players. As the Panthers aim to compensate for McCaffrey's absence, Samuel could continue to garner more usage as a gadget weapon on offense in Week 4 versus the Cardinals.",

Inman took advantage of the extra playing time by scoring a pair touchdowns, only to exit in the fourth quarter with an injury of his own. Results from an X-ray didn't show any fracture to his left wrist, but that doesn't necessarily mean Inman will be available for Sunday's game against Baltimore.",

He got his touchdown after all from 13 yards out with 1:54 left in the fourth quarter and was the only Raiders receiver to top 50 yards. Darren Waller (knee) and Josh Jacobs (hip) played through injuries, while Henry Ruggs (knee/hamstring) sat this one out and Bryan Edwards left the game with an ankle injury, so Renfrow is Las Vegas' healthiest regular skill position player heading into a Week 4 matchup with the Bills.",

Through three games, Hardman has elevated his numbers each week, and although he's still lacking consistency outside of devastating deep shots like Monday's score, the second-year pro is nonetheless trending in the right direction ahead of Week 4's game versus the Patriots.",

Assuming Chark is able to advance to full activity by Thursday or Friday, fantasy managers should expect him to be available for Sunday's game in Cincinnati.",

    "report": "Cole brought in four of five targets for 43 yards and returned one kickoff for 24 yards in the Jaguars' 31-13 loss to the Dolphins on Thursday.With DJ Chark (chest) sidelined for Thursday's game, Cole was third in receptions and second in receiving yardage on the night. The 27-year-old has gotten plenty of attention from quarterback Gardner Minshew through the first three games of the season, as he's now logged 17 targets, 15 of which he's brought in for 148 yards and two touchdowns. Cole saw his role diminish last season while playing with Minshew and Nick Foles -- he slumped to a career-low 24 receptions for 361 yards over 16 games -- but his outlook appears much brighter through the first three games of 2020. Cole will look to keep up the momentum, with or without Chark available, when the Jaguars face the Bengals in a Week 4 road matchup in Sunday, Oct. 4.",

    "report": "Jefferson recorded seven receptions on nine targets for 175 yards and a touchdown in Week 3 against Tennessee.Jefferson recorded a 71-yard touchdown halfway through the third quarter, breaking free on a play action pass for his first career score. Perhaps more surprisingly, he led Minnesota with nine targets -- four more than Adam Thielen received. While his trip to the end zone was his biggest play of the contest, Jefferson also added receptions of 33 and 31 yards to add to his breakout performance. Jefferson had combined for just six targets across the first two weeks of the campaign, though he could be in line for more work now that he's proven how explosive he can be.",

He delivered several big plays in the contest, including receptions of 21, 16 and 14 yards. Smith appears to be in the midst of a fourth-year breakout, as he's already accrued 20 targets -- nearly half of his previous season-best. The major caveat is his involvement once A.J. Brown (knee) is able to return, though Smith has shown good chemistry with quarterback Ryan Tannehill through three games.",

The fourth-year tight end was reportedly looking very explosive during training camp after missing the second  half of last season with a foot injury, but he's now averaging just 8.7 yards per grab on his 11 receptions through three games.

    "report": "Kittle (knee) practiced without limitations Wednesday, Keiana Martin of the 49ers' official site reports.Kittle finally is in the clear after missing the last two games with a sprained MCL and bone bruise in his left knee. Upon his return Sunday versus the Eagles, he'll again have access to most of the TE reps in the wake of Jordan Reed (knee) being placed on IR with the expectation he'll be sidelined up to 6-to-8 weeks. There is a chance Deebo Samuel (foot) makes his season debut Week 4, but his presence may open up the offense even more for Kittle to produce.",

    "report": "Ertz corralled seven of 10 targets for 70 receiving yards during Sunday's 23-23 tie against the Bengals.Ertz, Miles Sanders (eight targets) and Greg Ward (11 targets) were the clear go-to options Week 3, as no other Eagles player attracted more than four passes throughout the course of the 70-minute contest. In terms of Ertz' fantasy outlook going forward, there is little reason to suggest he will see a decrease in usage given that Dallas Goedert (ankle) is \"expected to miss some time,\" per Ian Rapoport of NFL Network. Philadelphia is also coping with a cluster of injuries to the receiving corps, with DeSean Jackson (hamstring) joining Jalen Reagor (thumb) and Alshon Jeffery (foot) on the sideline because of an in-game injury. As one of few targets Wentz can still reliably trust, Ertz should expect plenty of work Week 4 against a San Francisco defense that currently has Ahkello Witherspoon (hamstring) and Richard Sherman (calf) dealing with injury.",

As only one tight end in the league (Noah Fant) currently has a higher passer rating when targeted than Hockenson's gaudy measure of 155.8, per Pro Football Focus, there's a case to be made that Hockenson should be more involved going forward. However, there could also be more days when the Lions opt to pound the rock 22 times with Adrian Peterson, whose heavy usage at the expense of second-round pick D'Andre Swift suggests Detroit was trying to stick to the running game. The chances of the Lions being able to control the clock Week 4 seem low against a Saints team that has allowed the fifth-fewest yards per carry in the league through three weeks.",

On the bright side, Andrews at least led Baltimore in targets, setting a new season high in the category as well. Following back-to-back down performances, Andrews should be desperate to return to his best form in Week 4 versus Washington.",

    "report": "Tonyan secured all five of his targets for 50 yards and a touchdown in Sunday's 37-30 win over the Saints.Tonyan stuck as the top tight end option for Green Bay, seeing the field on nearly two-thirds of the team's offensive snaps for the third straight contest. The undrafted product of Indiana State saw his usage in the passing game increase for the third consecutive game as well, culminating in a career-best 50 receiving yards while finding the end zone for the second time in as many weeks. Tonyan is quietly making some noise in fantasy circles, as any starter playing alongside this rejuvenated version of Aaron Rodgers should garner attention. The 26-year-old shouldn't be considered a top TE option yet, but it is worth monitoring his production against the Falcons in Week 4 in the event his recent hot streak continues.",

At least one aspect of the Jets has looked absolutely horrid every week, and it was the passing game's turn in this one as quarterback Sam Darnold threw for just 168 yards and tossed three interceptions, two of which were returned for touchdowns. While game script should be playing in Herndon's favor with the Jets getting blown out every week, his lack of downfield involvement limits the tight end's upside.

    "headlineNews": "Chargers' Hunter Henry: Kept in check",
    "report": "Henry gathered five of his seven targets for 50 yards in the 21-16 loss Sunday to the Panthers.It might not have been a massive performance for Henry, but the tight end was an athletic mismatch in the middle of the field for Justin Herbert to continue to rely on. That's now three games in which Henry has caught at least five passes, and he's been targeted 23 times during that stretch, good for second best on the team. Curiously, he's been less than involved in the red zone, although both of the team's scores came from outside 10 yards. The Buccaneers, who play the Chargers in Week 4, just held Noah Fant to a paltry 46 yards across 10 targets, so fantasy managers might want to temper expectations when it comes to Henry's performance next week.",

    "report": "Thomas caught four of seven targets for 31 yards in Sunday's 34-20 loss to the Browns, playing 85 percent of snaps on offense.Thomas has finished first or second on the team in targets in every game this season, but it hasn't translated to consistent production, as he's now on pace for a 64-501-5 receiving line on 128 targets. If nothing else, his catch rate should improve as the year moves along, though efficient production may be too much to ask for in an offense with Dwayne Haskins at quarterback. Thomas is tied for the second-most targets (24) among tight ends, so he's at least on the map as a low-end fantasy option for Week 4 against the Ravens.",

    "report": "Gesicki caught one of three targets for a 15-yard touchdown in the Dolphins' 31-13 win over the Jaguars on Thursday.The third-year tight end was nowhere near as prolific as four days prior against the Bills, but Gesicki still rewarded fantasy managers with his second touchdown grab of the season. The Penn State product may see his reception volume fluctuate depending on game flow, but based on his strong second-half finish in 2019 and early returns this season, it's clear Gesicki's fantasy prospects are on the right trajectory. He'll look to play a bigger role in a Week 4 home matchup against the Seahawks on Sunday, Oct. 4.",

The veteran tight end continued to see heavy use as a blocker, but he also emerged in the passing game with six catches for 48 yards on seven targets after having drawn only three looks combined over the first two weeks. With Chris Godwin (hamstring) in danger of missing the next two games and Scotty Miller (hip) and Justin Watson (shoulder) both banged up, Gronkowski could again be in store for an elevated target count Sunday against the Chargers.",

This was certainly not an ideal matchup for Fant, as Tampa Bay entered Sunday holding the longest active streak of games without a TE touchdown allowed (dating back to Week 12 of last year). An upcoming Thursday night matchup against the Jets may help get Fant back in the end zone; New York has already surrendered three receiving TDs to opposing TEs.",

At his peak, Smith racked up 267 yards and three touchdowns between Weeks 12 and 17 last year, but with Evan Engram now back in the fold after missing the latter half of 2019 due to a foot injury, the 23-year-old Smith has attracted a mere five targets in two games. Smith and the Giants will see a 49ers defense in Week 3 that is without the services of Nick Bosa (knee), Richard Sherman (calf), and Solomon Thomas (knee), though as a whole San Francisco has conceded the second-fewest tight end receptions in the NFL to this point.",

    "report": "Higbee caught both his targets for 40 yards during Sunday's 35-32 loss to Buffalo. He also caught a pass to complete a two-point conversion.After scoring three touchdowns last week against Philadelphia, it wasn't surprising to see Buffalo focus on slowing down Higbee, and he didn't catch a pass until halfway through the third quarter. The fourth-year tight end did have an impressive 31-yard reception and remains a focal point of the passing attack, but opposing teams could also continue game planning to keep him in check. Week-to-week inconsistently could quickly prove to be part and parcel for Higbee moving forward.",

    "report": "Hooper caught three of four targets for 25 yards in Sunday's 34-20 win over Washington.Hooper posted season highs in receptions and yards, but he has not played a large role as a receiver through three games despite playing 86 percent of the offensive snaps. The Browns deployed a similar play-calling mix as in last week's win over the Bengals when they ran 60 percent of the time. That's been a winning formula, but a Week 4 date with a Dallas squad that ranks seventh in points per game could lead to a more wide-open affair, and more opportunities for Hooper.",

James O'Shaughnessy officially received the start but played only 27 offensive snaps, though he caught three of four targets for 29 yards. Eifert remains the Jaguars' top tight end, but his six catches for 55 yards and one touchdown through three games illustrates the difficulty in utilizing him as a fantasy option.",

    "report": "Graham caught six passes for 60 yards and two touchdowns in Chicago's 30-26 win over the Falcons on Sunday.With the Bears playing from behind for most of this contest, they were forced to go with a pass-heavy attack, resulting in Graham being targeted 10 times, which was second on the team behind Allen Robinson. He was also targeted in the end zone on two different occasions, but both attempts fell incomplete. Once Nick Foles took over under cente forr Mitchell Trubisky early in the second half, it was clear that Foles was very comfortable throwing the ball to his tight end, leading to seven of his targets coming after the quarterback change. Between being targeted 17 times and his high usage in the red zone this season, he has the look of a solid streaming option at tight end.",

That said, the fact that he's beginning the week on the field is a good sign with regard to his chances of being available in Sunday's game against the Raiders. Even if Knox gets the green light to play this weekend, he may have to fight to earn some looks in the passing game after Buffalo's other tight ends combined for three touchdown receptions from quarterback Josh Allen in the Week 3 win over the Rams.",

    "report": "Everett caught both of his targets for 34 yards during Sunday's 35-32 loss to Buffalo.While his 34 receiving yards hardly moved the fantasy needle, both grabs showed off Everett's athleticism. He's talented and has the potential to be a solid fantasy contributor, but his target share will probably never provide enough opportunities as long as the Rams are healthy, and especially with fellow tight end Tyler Higbee clearly ahead of him on the depth chart. There's still a chance Everett proves to be a late bloomer, so keeper/dynasty managers should add him to their watch lists in case he finds a larger role elsewhere -- he's in the final year of his rookie contract, after all.",

Meanwhile, for the second straight week, Devin Asiasi recorded 10 snaps and zero targets, and fellow rookie Dalton Keene (neck) was inactive. Izzo remains the Patriots' most trusted tight end while the younger players at the position are worked in gradually, but he's not seeing enough volume in the team's passing game to merit fantasy attention in anything but the deepest of formats.",

    "headlineNews": "Cardinals' Dan Arnold: Little involvement against Lions",
    "report": "Arnold hauled in one of his two targets for 11 yards during Sunday's 26-23 loss to the Lions.The Wisconsin-Platteville standout did not enjoy prolific outings in Weeks 1 or 2 either, but he managed multiple receptions and at least 21 receiving yards in each of those contests. Week 3 marked a down week not only in terms of Arnold's statistical production but also in regards to his usage, as he logged a season-low 31 offensive snaps (his previous season low being 45). Arnold's upcoming matchup against Carolina is not a particularly appealing one, as the Panthers have allowed 108 receiving yards and no touchdowns to opposing tight ends this season.",
