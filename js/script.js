It's the second straight week Mahomes has received an early breather, though unlike Week 7 in Denver, he heads to the bench with monster fantasy numbers. Mahomes decked Gregg Williams' pathetic defense for scores of 30, 36, three, 26 and 41 yards. The first was a Mecole Hardman jet sweep that Mahomes got credit for, while the fifth was a bomb down the left sideline where Tyreek Hill got a step on a falling Bless Austin. No. 3 was an underhanded softball-type pitch to Travis Kelce near the goal line. Mahomes will enter his Week 9 start against the Panthers with 21 touchdowns compared to one pick. He is on pace for 4,630 yards at the season's midway point. Those numbers are like Aaron Rodgers in his prime, though still off Mahomes' MVP 2018.\u00a0\n",

Rodgers' MVS strikes came after the maddening deep threat dropped an easy third down conversion early in the second quarter. That drew a Rodgers glare, but the quarterback hit his stone-handed wideout for a wide-open 52-yard score late in the first half. Rodgers appeared to barely move his feet before launching a missile along a perfect arc. Needed for very little after the break, Rodgers rested the final five minutes. Rodgers has now delivered three or more scores in five of his past six starts, and six times on the season. He should easily stay scorching against the Jaguars in Week 10.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "The Giants gave Brady some fits in this one, sacking him twice, and forcing him into a couple errant throws, but the Bucs were able to survive and move to 6-2. Brady's two touchdowns were second-half, inside-the-10 hookups with Rob Gronkowski and Mike Evans from three and eight yards out, respectively. The Evans one was a perfectly-thrown fade over the top of CB James Bradberry. Brady has multiple touchdown passes in 6-of-8 games and has settled in as a solid floor way with an elevated ceiling as a QB1. He'll get Antonio Brown added to his arsenal in Week 9 against the Saints, and Chris Godwin also hopes to return from his broken index finger.\n",

Cousins took a backseat, attempting a season-low in passes; his longest completion\u00a0was actually a screen pass that Cook turned upfield for a 50-yard touchdown in the first half. As always with Cousins, his production comes\u00a0down to whether or not he's\u00a0forced to pass (and he wasn't on Sunday). He'll again be ranked as a high floor QB2 in Week 9 against the Lions.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Foles gashed New Orleans' secondary in the first half, hitting Darnell Mooney for a 50-yard gain \u2014 Chicago's longest offensive play of the year \u2014 and capping that drive with a 24-yard touchdown to Allen Robinson. Foles\u00a0also had a wobbly near-interception dropped by Marshon Lattimore in the fourth quarter. All in all, it was another underwhelming performance\u00a0from the 31-year-old veteran who at least took advantage of New Orleans' struggling secondary. Week 9 offers another cush matchup against Tennessee's defense, but fantasy players can't chase Foles' production from this one since he's still just a bad\u00a0play or two\u00a0away from being benched in favor of Mitchell Trubisky.\u00a0\n",

The first half looked like much of the same with Lock going 9-of-15 for 58 scoreless yards at the break. But the Chargers ended up blowing a 21-point lead, and Lock was a big part of it on the stat sheet. His three fourth-quarter touchdowns went to Albert\u00a0Okwuegbunam (9 yards), DaeSean Hamilton (40), and the game-winner to KJ Hamler (1) as time expired. Lock has been mostly bad as a sophomore, but he made the throws in the final 15 minutes of this one. Lock gets an easy draw in Atlanta for Week 9 but still won't be anything more than a recommended back-end QB2.\n",

Jones' 256 passing yards go down as his most since Week 1, but he was mostly bad in this one and should've thrown two or three more interceptions. Turnovers have always been Jones' problem, as he tends to make some of the dumbest decisions we see week in and week out at the quarterback position, constantly making idiotic throws into coverage. Darius Slayton bailed him out late in the fourth quarter on a drive where Jones ended it with a perfect throw to Golden Tate for a 19-yard score. Jones' throw on the ensuing two-point conversion attempt to tie the game, however, was way off the mark to Dion Lewis, who was open in the end zone. Jones just isn't very good and is probably flirting with getting benched. The Giants go to Washington in Week 9.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "It was Tannehill's second worst start of the season, while he's now completed fewer than 20 passes in back-to-back losses. Tannehill was lucky to escape with only one pick, having a second undone by a Bengals neutral zone infraction. For score No. 1, A.J. Brown did all the work after the catch. For No. 2, Corey Davis made a sensational grab in the front right corner of the end zone. Despite the rough stretch, this has not had the feel of Tannehill getting \"exposed\" or whatever you might want to call it. That being said, Tannehill will have a difficult time snapping his mini slump in Week 9, where the Titans will be hosting the Bears' strong defense. He will be more of a QB2 than QB1 for that one.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "The yardage output was Bridgewater's lowest of the season on a night where he almost didn't make it 60 minutes. Egregiously tripped on a late third quarter scramble, Bridgewater busted loose to slide only to take a sickening head shot from DE Charles Harris. Harris was ejected, but Bridgewater missed multiple plays as he was evaluated for a concussion and got his neck stretched out. He was officially announced with a neck ailment before returning after P.J. Walker ran the offense for a few minutes. Whereas Walker immediately tried to make a few things happen down the field, Bridgewater was even more conservative than usual this evening, failing to get anything going deep until the game's dying moments. By then it was too late. Bridgewater did not look the same after returning from his neck injury, dialing up one checkdown after another behind a shaky offensive line. Bridgewater has helped get Curtis Samuel going the past two weeks, but Robby Anderson and D.J. Moore both had quiet games tonight. Offering decent floor but zero upside, Bridgewater will be a top 15-16 option for Week 9 against the Chiefs.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Joe Flacco will start Monday night's game. Per coach Adam Gase, Darnold was \"having issues throwing on Friday and the ball was not coming out like normal.\" Darnold's injury is supposedly just a minor aggravation of his early-season shoulder issue, but it's never a great sign when a quarterback has a lingering shoulder ailment. Darnold's seemingly make-or-break third season has been thoroughly broken under clueless coach Adam Gase, at least so far. Even with the Patriots struggling, Flacco offers zero Week 9 upside.\u00a0\n",

He also became the third player in franchise history to record four touchdowns\u00a0in a single game.

He ended up ceding only 14 touches to backups Tyler Ervin and Dexter Williams, and played into the fourth quarter of a blowout. Although tonight was the first time all season that Jones was held out of the end zone, he re-proved his health and now has 10 days to rest up for a mouthwatering home matchup with the Jaguars.\u00a0\n",

Hasty had been pegged as \"likely\" to lead this evening's backfield by the local media, but instead it was another tease for a player who can't quite get there despite all the injuries around him. Even if Tevin Coleman (knee) remains sidelined for Week 10 against the Saints, it has gotten to the point where Hasty can't be trusted as more than a zero-floor FLEX option.\u00a0\n",

It was another bizarre game for Gurley, who disappeared for a long stretch in the first half seemingly without injury. Gurley was struggling and coach Raheem Morris seemed to want to see what Brian Hill could do. Hill looked far more explosive than his veteran teammate, logging nine more yards on seven fewer carries, but Gurley eventually returned like nothing had happened. Four days after scoring a game-losing\u00a0touchdown against the Lions, Gurley committed another horrible late-game gaffe when he went out of bounds on third down with 3:11 remaining. The Falcons were trying to run out the clock/make the Panthers burn timeouts. Morris can't be pleased. Gurley still does fine when the Falcons dial up a stretch run, but he has almost zero lateral agility remaining. He will remain a workload-based RB2 for Week 9 against the Broncos.\u00a0\n",

Evidently his legs weren't tired anymore. McKinnon looked fine, but it was hard to judge anything the 49ers did playing with their B-team offense against a Packers defense that lost Jaire Alexander in the first half. McKinnon's score redefined garbage time, as he notched a one-yard plunge with the 49ers trailing 34-10 with :04 remaining. Mostert will be out for Week 10 against the Saints. Coleman's status is uncertain. McKinnon will be a top-36 option even if Coleman plays, and top 24-28 if he sits.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Moss was used extensively in the red zone but did not see a single target. However, that could be a result of the low passing volume overall for Buffalo. Josh Allen only attempted 18 passes. Devin Singletary was targeted just once. Moss's role is going to be very volatile on a weekly basis but he appears to have cemented himself as just as much of a threat as Singletary. If his role as the red zone back on a high-scoring offense remains steady in the coming weeks, Moss will be a weekly RB3.\n",

Limited in practice throughout the week after tweaking the hamstring late in Week 8's loss to the Eagles, Elliott has puts fantasy managers in a tough spot. It's not often that a first round pick should be treated as a RB3 option, but that's exactly what fantasy players should do in Week 9. Tony Pollard would become an intriguing start if Zeke sits. Pollard should be rostered in all formats.\u00a0\n",

Evans' yards haven't been there this year, but he's been one of the premier red-zone dominators in the scoring area with Brady. With Antonio Brown and Chris Godwin debuting and coming back, respectively, in the very near future, Evans faces even more competition for targets, but he and Rob Gronkowski should remain Brady's favorite red-zone targets. Evans will be more of a boom-bust WR2 next week against the Saints.\n",

Thielen's\u00a0four targets (as many as Justin Jefferson had) are disappointing if only because Packers CB Jaire Alexander instead shadowed Jefferson Sunday. Fantasy players can confidently go back to Thielen as a high-end WR2 with more volume in Week 9 against Detroit.\n",

    "analysis": "Adams also drew a DPI that set the Packers up at the one-yard line in the second quarter. The 150-yard effort was Adams' third of the season, and second in three weeks. He now has 36 catches for 483 yards and six touchdowns in four games since returning from his hamstring injury. Pure dominance. Adams' score was a 36-yarder where he bullied Emmanuel Moseley in hand-to-hand combat on a go route. Running away with No. 1 overall status at receiver, Adams has another potential eruption spot in the Jaguars for Week 10.\u00a0\n",

The box score won't show that Jefferson also drew an end zone target and DPI on Alexander in the first half. The rookie will again be ranked as a high-end WR2 in Week 9 against Detroit.\n",

    "analysis": "Entering the proceedings with 16 catches 234 yards over his past two games, Jones stayed scorching, stacking up four receptions for 85 yards in the game's first 10 minutes. The bad news is, Matt Ryan failed to connect with his alpha wideout on not one, not two, but three end zone targets. The force field was back this evening. Jones' output was likely also affected by rain that really picked up after halftime. The big going forward takeaway was Calvin Ridley departing with an ankle injury. It did not have the looks of a season ender, but the Falcons head on bye after next week's date with the Broncos. Ridley is probably on the wrong side of questionable for Week 9. Jones will remain a locked-in top-three WR1.\u00a0\n",

The 36-yarder was a laser where Hill split a pair of DBs. The 41-yarder was a strike down the left sideline where Hill bested a falling Bless Austin. With 50 percent of 2020 now in the books, Hill is on pace for 70/1,074/14. Hill is a good bet to overshoot those first two totals.

    "analysis": "Moore's first catch did not come until 2:58 remaining, when he hauled in a 13-yarder to inaugurate a potential game-tying drive. He then corralled a 42-yarder on 3rd-and-17 moments later, putting rookie CB A.J. Terrell on skates. That was all she wrote for a player who entered the evening with three straight 93-yard performances. Amazingly, Moore's six targets this evening were actually second most in his past four games. Robby Anderson once again led the Panthers in looks. Frustrating, but Moore is doing enough damage down the field to keep himself in the top 12-18 on a weekly basis. The Chiefs' tough defense is on tap for a Week 9 matchup that is sure to have a high total.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Ruggs' lack of targets is officially a concern. Since returning from injury, Ruggs has target totals of three, three, and four. Perhaps his role would've been larger if not for poor weather, but Ruggs is only a desperation WR5 in hopes of big plays. Today, Ruggs missed out on what should've been a long gain (Derek Carr missed him deep) and what should've been a touchdown if the referees had better vision in the corner of the end zone. A date with the Chargers next week isn't one to target for the first-round speedster despite flashing in limited reps.\n",

His three-yard touchdown along the sideline helped bring the Bears within a field goal with only 6:25 remaining in the final quarter. Fantasy players should still note that Anthony Miller (8/73) was actually used over Mooney on Sunday, collecting a team-high 11 targets on 85% of Nick Foles' dropbacks. That will be something to monitor moving forward as one of the two behind Allen Robinson offer deep league value if able to separate from the other in two-wide sets down the stretch.\n",

Davis has rebounded from his 2019 career nadir this season, clearing 69 yards in 3-of-5 appearances and five catches in 4-of-5. He is still ultimately unlikely to rise above WR4 status, but Davis has at least managed to establish\u00a0a floor. The Bears are on tap for Week 9.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "The receiving score was Samuel's first of the season, but the rushing was his second in as many games. The aerial strike came on a flea flicker where Teddy Bridgewater got just enough air underneath the pass to get it over Ricardo Allen's coverage. The rushing touchdown again came with Samuel lined up as a true running back. He looked like a natural on the 12-yard weave to the goal line. The Panthers are forcing the issue with Samuel since his return from his knee ailment, but there still aren't a ton of looks to go around behind Robby Anderson and D.J. Moore. Samuel is an upside WR4 you can start in a bye week or injury pinch. There are worse things in fantasy. The Chiefs are on deck for Week 9.\u00a0\n",

The inconsistent deep threat committed a brutal third down drop in the opening minutes of the second quarter. That drew a glare from Aaron Rodgers. Instead of ignoring his wideout for the rest of the night, Rodgers found him for scores of 52 and one yards. The 52-yarder was an impossible-to-defense pass Rodgers arced over the entire D to a wide-open MVS. The one-yard score came as Rodgers rolled to his right on third down and found MVS in the back right corner of the end zone. Especially with Allen Lazard (core) likely to return for Week 10 against the Jaguars, MVS' targets are not about to increase, but he will continue to offer big-play potential as a desperation WR4.\u00a0\n",

We would assume that Reed, who was playing well before landing on injured reserve with a knee injury, will probably take the going forward targets lead over Dwelley, but Dwelley remaining involved in any fashion would kneecap Reed's TE2 value catching passes from Nick Mullens.

Andrews, who had a couple miscommunications with Lamar Jackson in Week 8, could put fantasy managers in a difficult spot if the Ravens are ultra run heavy for the remainder of the season. You likely won't find a better tight end option on the waiver wire though. Andrews should remain in lineups next week against the Colts.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Witten spent 16 seasons with the Cowboys from 2003-2019. The most-recent version of the veteran TE wasn't all that great, as Witten set career-low marks in both yards per reception (8.4) and yards per target (6.4) in 2019. The fit with the Raiders is even more puzzling considering the presence of both Darren Waller and Foster Moreau. It's unlikely that Witten sees enough targets and snaps to work as a standalone fantasy option in 2020, but his presence undoubtedly lowers the ceiling of both Waller and Moreau.\n",
