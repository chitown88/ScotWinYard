        "analysis": "Watson appeared to throw a touchdown to DeAndre Hopkins in the second quarter, but the play was ruled a sack because he was in the defender's grasp, so Houston had to settle for a field goal. Hopkins was his target on a pivotal 4th-and-1 while facing a 28-16 deficit early in the fourth, but the pass didn't connect. Things got even worse for Watson when he was picked off on the next drive, but he bounced back by hitting Hopkins for a four-yard touchdown before throwing another interception to seal the loss in the final minute. Watson has had an up-and-down season under center, with 11 passing touchdowns in his three best outings and just two in his other four games. Despite the inconsistency, Watson remains a strong fantasy play for his team's Week 8 meeting with the Raiders.",

With Mahomes likely to miss around three weeks of action in a best-case scenario, the Chiefs could promote undrafted rookie Kyle Shurmur from the practice squad and/or add another quarterback to the roster via free agency or trade, but Moore should get the first crack at filling in as the team's starting quarterback.

Fitzpatrick hit DeVante Parker for his one touchdown pass, which came from 12 yards out in the latter portion of the second quarter. The veteran quarterback then brought the Miami sidelines to life by capping off an 11-play, 60-yard fourth-quarter drive with a gutsy 11-yard scoring scramble that he finished by lowering his shoulder to get into the end zone. Fitzpatrick was reinstated as the starter mid-week after coach Brian Flores backtracked from an earlier statement that Josh Rosen would keep the top job, and given Fitzpatrick's performance Sunday, he's certainly poised to helm the passing attack again in a Week 8 Monday night matchup versus the Steelers.",

Despite Jones' struggles, the Giants have little to gain by turning the starting gig back over to 38-year-old Eli Manning, who has no place in the team's future plans and probably wouldn't offer an upgrade from the rookie in any area other than turnover prevention.

After following up with the media Monday, Callahan now seems to have extended Keenum's leash at least two more games, though an ugly showing versus the Vikings could lead the coach to re-evaluate things. Keenum has completed 66 percent of his pass attempts and owns a 9:4 TD:INT in six appearances, but he's only thrown for four touchdowns over his past four starts and was already pulled from the starting job once in favor of Colt McCoy. At this point, McCoy probably isn't a realistic threat to jump Keenum in the pecking order, but first-round pick Dwayne Haskins should receive another look at some point once the Redskins are convinced the rookie is up to the task.",

Monday also marked the first time Bell topped 4.0 yards per carry this season. While his numbers admittedly came in a blowout, and he's now finished with merely one catch in back-to-back games, Bell can at least take some personal pride from his performance.

        "analysis": "The Chargers tried to get Gordon into a rhythm early on, forcing him 12 of his 16 carries in the first half. However, he managed just 28 rushing yards on those attempts, causing the team to move away from the run game after halftime. In addition to the poor efficiency, Gordon also lost a fumble at the goal line with 19 seconds remaining in the game to secure defeat for the Chargers. While he has clearly been the team's top back over Austin Ekeler since returning in Week 5 against Denver, Gordon has averaged just 2.25 yards per carry. Given his critical error in Week 7 and his inability to hit long runs, it wouldn't be particularly surprising to see the Chargers give Ekeler a few extra looks Week 8 against the Bears.",

McKissic, and we think those guys are ready to step into roles.\"",
        "analysis": "Coming into Week 8, Ty Johnson was already a popular waiver-wire target with the expectation that Kerryon would be sidelined for multiple games. With Kerryon now requiring surgery that will keep him sidelined through mid-December, Ty should get the first crack at leading the Lions' ground game, though Patricia suggested that McKissic and new acquisition Tra Carson could mix in as well. After Kerryon exited early in the 42-30 loss to the Vikings last weekend, Ty played 64 percent of Detroit's offensive snaps the rest of the way, finishing the afternoon with 57 total yards on 14 touches (10 carries, four receptions). Meanwhile, McKissic racked up 60 yards on seven touches (five carries, two receptions), but only played 25 percent of the snaps.",

However, he amassed 20 carries for the third time in his last four games, providing him with volume to cover up his lack of efficiency. His most impactful run came late in the fourth quarter, when he scored on an 11-yard run for what turned out to be the game-winning score. Henry will clearly remain an integral part of the Titans' offense with Ryan Tannehill under center, though his lack of involvement in the passing game will cap his potential upside. In addition, Henry will draw a tough matchup against the Buccaneers' stout run defense in Week 8.",

McCoy may be tasked with more offensive responsibility in any games Patrick Mahomes (knee) misses, and he'll look to continue producing at the expense of the Packers in Week 8, a week from Sunday.",

The buy-low window on the elite wide receiver may have closed with this effort, and he'll look to build on this performance against the Raiders in Week 8.",

Fantasy owners who can maintain their faith in the talented youngster might just benefit from a significant bounce-back performance Week 8 when Golladay takes aim at a Giants defense that has allowed the second-most yards per pass attempt in 2019.",

The rookie's one miscue was costly, however, as he gave up the ball at Miami's 28-yard line with the Bills clinging to a 17-14 lead. The loose ball was recovered by Buffalo's Jerry Hughes and returned to the Dolphins' 11-yard line, and Cole Beasley crossed the goal line three plays later on a three-yard scoring grab. On the brighter side, both Williams' reception and receiving yardage tallies were career highs, and he'll look to build on those numbers against the Steelers in a Week 8 Monday night showdown.",

Even so, coach Doug Pederson denies that the rehab process is taking longer than expected, noting that the Eagles never considered placing the 32-year-old on injured reserve, per Zack Rosenblatt of The Newark Star-Ledger. That sounds like a contradiction, as Jackson is in danger of meeting the IR requirement of eight missed games anyway, all while taking up a spot on the 53-man roster. Pederson admitted last week that Jackson isn't likely to be 100 percent healthy even after he's ready to return.",

However, once the game was out of hand in the last five minutes, he was able to compile some late production to salvage his fantasy day. He's now been targeted at least seven times in each of his last two contests, and he may be starting to work his way into fantasy relevance.",

The 29-year-old wideout slotted in as the Seahawks' No. 3 wide receiver once again, seeing 43 of a possible 70 offensive snaps (60 percent), although David Moore was close behind with a season-high 30 snaps. With Will Dissly (Achilles) out, Brown garnered a red-zone target as well but couldn't haul it in. The Seahawks will look to bounce back in Week 8 against a struggling Falcons secondary.",

In the two contests that Perriman missed, Miller caught three of nine targets for 39 yards and a touchdown. Perriman himself has notched only three catches (on 12 targets) for 16 yards across four appearances.",

However, that volume has resulted in just nine receptions, 101 yards and no scores. Allison is getting his opportunities right now, but with Adams due back at some point, and fellow wideouts Jake Kumerow and Allen Lazard pushing for more snaps, he could eventually see fewer chances if his output does not increase.",

Fans had been waiting for more than five games to see Waller find paydirt, however, and he finally delivered midway through the third quarter with a seven-yard jumping grab in the back of the end zone. He followed up with a 17-yard touchdown from Mike Glennon toward the end of the game. Waller has caught at least six passes in five of six games and has gone over 120 yards twice this season. If Sunday's red-zone success finally got a monkey off Waller's back, then one of the league's most consistent tight ends might just have become one of the league's most dominant.",

        "analysis": "Ertz -- and the Eagles' passing attack as a whole -- couldn't get into any sort of rhythm against the Cowboys' relentless defense. The star tight end set new season lows in receptions, yards and targets in one fell swoop. Outside of this dud, Ertz had been the model of consistency with averages of 5.5 receptions and 61.0 yards over his previous six contests. The recent emergence of fellow tight end Dallas Goedert (four receptions, 69 yards and a touchdown) could frustrate Ertz's fantasy owners, but Sunday's role reversal should be written off as an anomaly, as the latter is still the top dog heading into a matchup against the Bills on Sunday.",

He also set season highs in catches and yards. Ebron will hope to build on this performance when the Broncos come to town in Week 8.",

Zach Ertz remains the top tight end in this passing attack, but coach Doug Pederson may be trending toward more formations with two tight ends to aid a wide receiving corps that has taken a beating this season.
