    "report": "",
    "analysis": "With his team in a gut check moment after getting humiliated at home in the wind by the Pats three weeks ago, Allen put together a complete performance as the Bills pulled even with the Pats at 9-6 in the AFC East. Despite missing two of his top-four receivers in Cole Beasley and Gabriel Davis, Allen's 314 passing yards were his most in six weeks. He found fill-in slot man Isaiah McKenzie for a ridiculous 11/125/1. Allen's 64 yards on the ground, his second most of the entire season, might have been even more impressive since the Pats sold out to keep him contained behind the line of scrimmage. Allen's third touchdown, a little goal line flip to Dawson Knox, was emblematic of a performance where he just kept finding ways to make plays. His reward is a season-ending pair of comically soft matchups in the Falcons and Jets as the Bills try to clinch the division.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

Brady may still have some stuff to work out with Brown as his only receiver of note but it was a good start to what will likely be multiple absences for Evans. Godwin is out for the year with a torn ACL. Brady remains a top-five fantasy option heading into Week 17.\n",

Still, if he does suit up, Jackson would remain at the back end of the QB ranks in his matchup with the Rams.\n",

His longest throw came on a 50-yard completion to Derrick Gore down the sideline on a blown coverage. Without Travis Kelce (COVID-19) in the lineup, Mahomes spread the ball around with intermediate passes, leaving Tyreek Hill with two catches on two targets for 19 yards. Mahomes was still effective, but it's clear -- for now -- his role is to manage the team's offense while the Chiefs defense wrecks opponents, as they did Sunday against Pittsburgh. Mahomes will be a solid floor option in Week 17 against the Bengals.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "For those curious how the Rams eked out a win (and playoff berth) despite Stafford's egregious performance, look no further than Sony Michel's 27 carries for 131 yards and a goal-line score, recording his second 100-yard rushing game for Los Angeles. It was ultimately Stafford's fourth game with multiple turnovers this year and first three-interception game since 2018, finding Odell Beckham for a seven-yard touchdown in the final quarter to make the signal caller's box score seem a tad more respectful. The Rams, currently first place in the NFC West, are suddenly positioned to win their first division title since 2018.\n",

He added that he doesn't want to be a \"bum\" at the end of his career and wants to go out at a high level. Rodgers also stated he won't draw it out for months, and it will be a \"quick decision.\" The 38-year-old is the betting favorite for a second straight MVP award and is playing some of the best football of his career. Maybe winning a Super Bowl would play a factor in his decision. For what it's worth, Rodgers said his relationship with GM Brian Gutekunst has gotten better since a tumultuous last offseason, and he's not thinking about playing elsewhere at the moment.\n",

Mike Williams and Austin Ekeler being on the COVID list played a role in that, while safety Derwin James was active but didn't play any snaps.

Dallas had already clinched a playoff spot and the NFC East with the Titans and Raiders winning this week. Prescott and the Cowboys will take aim at the No. 1 seed with a matchup against the Cardinals in Week 17.\n",

The broadcast pointed out that Murray hit 20.78 mph on the play, the fastest any quarterback has run all season. Murray totaled 74 yards on the ground and hand another 10+ run called back by a holding penalty. Murray wasn't quite as impactful through the air. He did have some nice throws, including a TD to Antoine Wesley that he dropped in the bucket from 24 yards out. Murray struggled a bit with accuracy, however, with balls both sailing high and landing at his receivers' feet. Murray also struggled to run the hurry-up offense without bleeding the clock when down two scores in the fourth quarter. Murray gets a very difficult test against the Cowboys in Week 17. He will be a QB1 but will have a lower floor than is ideal for the fantasy championship game.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "With the loss, Seattle is eliminated from postseason contention for just the second time in Wilson's 10-year career. He flat-out wasn't good enough against a team running low on healthy corners and starting its No. 3 quarterback, targeting DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett a combined 11 times, finding them for just 5/71/1. This, even as Rashaad Penny was relieving pressure on the ground with 17/135/1. The low point, besides an anemic final drive after Chicago converted a two-point conversion to go up 25-24 with 1:01 remaining, was a fourth quarter sequence where Wilson took an inexcusable 13-yard sack on third down to set up a 39-yard field goal that Jason Myers promptly missed. The magic just has not been there in the seven games since Wilson returned from his finger injury. He badly needs the offseason to get physically right, and perhaps either force a coaching change or trade. This era of Seahawks football is over ... after a Week 17 hosting of Detroit and Week 18 road trip to Arizona.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Cousins' lone turnover was his first redzone interception of the 2021 season, entering Week 16 with 21 touchdowns and no picks inside the 20-yard line. It was also his fifth interception in as many games after tossing two through Minnesota's first 10 contests. The real story is how putrid their offense performed in the first half,\u00a0going 1-for-7 on third down and averaging 2.6 yards per play on five of their first six drives. Cousins helped cut it close with a touchdown pass to K.J. Osborn with 8:21 remaining but it was ultimately too little too late for Minnesota's offense. The veteran still eclipsed 300-plus passing yards for the 20th time since joining the Vikings, surpassing Tommy Kramer and Daunte Culpepper for the most such games in franchise\u00a0history.\u00a0Minnesota, now 7-8, head to Lambeau Field in Week 17 for a must-win game to keep their playoff hopes alive.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Jones posted a 43.8 completion percentage and 4.5 YPA in his second straight dismal start. Jones' arm strength looked like a problem on an afternoon where he was forced to throw his entire body into the rare attempts he tried to send down the field. Of course, Jones' day would not have been as bad without some awful play from his receivers, none worse than N'Keal Harry. Engaged in a dropapalooza, Harry also turned an admittedly not great Jones target into a tipped-ball INT, one where Harry made no effort after the ball hit off his hands. Jones' second INT was a first half Hail Mary, so at least neither giveaway was egregious. Now mired in his worst stretch of his solid rookie year, Jones has a bounce-back Week 17 spot in the pathetic Jaguars.\u00a0\n",

That, however, seems exceedingly unlikely, especially if Rodgers propels the Packers to the Super Bowl. Mayfield's four-interception performance against Green Bay on Christmas provided Browns brass with \"even more minuses on their ledgers when deciding whether to offer Mayfield an extension with his contract expiring after the 2022 season,\" Ridenour said. Among the notable 2022 free agent QBs: Andy Dalton, Jameis Winston, Cam Newton, and Ryan Fitzpatrick. The Browns could also acquire a quarterback in the 2022 NFL Draft. Perhaps the Browns could pry Russell Wilson away from the Seahawks as Seattle's Super Bowl window has slammed shut. It's clear Mayfield is not the answer, and the team's window will shut in a hurry if they can't find a serviceable signal caller next season.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Wentz went on the Covid list this week, but the NFL's new protocols give him a good shot to return on Sunday. Wentz will be out of practice all week but the Colts plan to have him take the field anyway. Their alternative is to start rookie quarterback Sam Ehlinger. If Wentz can return it would be a boost to the Colts' offense as they take on a beatable Raiders defense. Regardless of who is at quarterback, the Colts will be leaning on Jonathan Taylor, but Wentz will make the offense more dynamic. He profiles as a QB2 for Week 17.\n",

    "analysis": "In the battle of Nos. 1 and 2 overall picks Trevor Lawrence and Wilson, the latter had the better day despite missing his top three wideouts and also got the win for bragging rights' purposes. Wilson's first score was a 52-yard scamper on a busted play where the Jaguars sent an all-out blitz. His touchdown pass was a one-yarder to OL Conor McDermott. The 91 rushing yards were easily Wilson's most of the season after entering Week 16 with just 70 yards on the ground. It was his fourth rushing score. Wilson will close out his first season with a home date against the Bucs in Week 17 followed by Week 18 at Buffalo.\n",

    "analysis": "With 16 players on the COVID list and another 10 on injured reserve, the Saints didn't stand a chance against Miami. Among those COVID'ed were star defensive players LB Demario Davis, SS Malcolm Jenkins, and LB Kwon Alexander. Tagovailoa still didn't do a whole lot, passing for less than 200 yards for the second straight game and third time in the last six starts. His touchdown was a one-yard flip to Jaylen Waddle, whom he hooked up with a total of 10 times for 92 yards and the score in this one. Tua's interception was a hideous downfield decision into double-coverage to Mack Hollins when Waddle was wide open underneath for a gain of 20-plus yards. After starting the season 1-7, the Dolphins have won seven straight on the back of their defense and are now sitting in the final AFC playoff spot ahead of a Week 17 date with the Titans in Nashville. Tua will be a middling QB2 for that one.\n",

    "analysis": "Tannehill entered halftime a comical 10-of-13 for 40 yards as the Titans appeared to actively be trying to lose eight yards every first down. Thankfully things snapped into place after the break as the Titans erased a 10-point deficit and put themselves in position to win the AFC South if the Colts lose on Saturday evening to the Cardinals. Tannehill got the only memo that mattered: Target a returning A.J. Brown whenever possible. Brown's 16 looks were a new career high by three. Tanne's longest completion was a 42-yarder to Brown on a free play. The biggest play was Tannehill's 23-yard rush with 1:20 remaining. That set the Titans up for the game-winning kick. Largely off the streamer map for the past month as Brown convalesced, Tannehill is finally back in the mix, though the Dolphins are an awful Week 17 matchup.\u00a0\n",

That sounds great on Wednesday, but given that the two players in question are Glnnon and Fromm, this plan is likely to devolve into a haphazard tilt spiral on gameday. The Giants passing game is radioactive for fantasy purposes. Even Saquon Barkley is unlikely to deliver a ton of value unless he can deliver enough big plays to overcome his atrocious circumstances.\u00a0\n",

Lawrence -- who's gone four weeks without throwing a touchdown -- has completed a hideous 16 of 56 deep passes for four touchdowns and six picks in his disastrous rookie season. Lawrence has operated as a check-down artist through most of 2021, ranking 23rd in deep ball rate. Losing deep-ball target DJ Chark in the first half of the season didn't help matters, but Lawrence's top-end potential as an NFL quarterback has to be questioned after such a consistently lousy rookie campaign. He's not a viable fantasy option.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Ryan was at best when targeting Kyle Pitts, which he did on 25% of his attempts; Pitts accounted for 47% of Ryan's passing yards. Ryan connected with his other tight end, Hayden Hurst, for his only TD of the day, hitting him for a 12 yard TD down the right side. Ryan didn't have the best day, but with Corderelle Patterson and Mike Davis totaling just 48 yards between them, his production through the air is what got the Falcons the win. Ryan could be in for an even less productive day against the Bills in Week 17, but will be in play as a QB2.\n",

Taylor definitely felt the effect of the Colts' diminished offensive line. He was frequently bottled up in the second half. Taylor was also targeted twice but didn't catch either. However, Taylor also busted loose for a 47 yard run on the Colts' first play of the game, and he was often too much for even a pile of Cardinals to stop. The Cardinals did hold Taylor out of the end zone, but just barely. Taylor took a carry from the five-yard line down to the one. Carson Wentz threw a TD to T.Y. Hilton on the following play. Taylor gets the Raiders run-funnel defense in Week 17. If his offensive line has more than one starter in action, he looks poised to carry fantasy managers to 2021 championships.\n",

Harris' pass game involvement -- he commanded seven targets against KC -- makes him far less game script sensitive than most early-down bangers in the NFL. His playing time dominance in Pittsburgh's offense keeps him on the field even when the team falls way behind, like they did against the Chiefs. Harris will again be touch-based RB1 in Week 17 against the Browns.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Chubb tied for the team lead with 58 receiving yards, which tells you how dominant he was in this game, and how little the Browns had going outside of their backfield. Chubb made his receiving day on a 40-yard screen pass, which looked so easy that it makes one wonder why Chubb screens aren't a staple of the Browns' offense. Chubb also showed incredible burst on a 27 yard run and displayed power and speed on multiple additional 10+ yard runs. D'Ernest Johnson mixed in throughout the game, but the Browns' entire offense was built around Chubb this week. He has a chance for another huge game against the run-funnel Steelers defense in Week 17.\n",

Other players coming back from COVID have seen their snaps scaled back for a week or two. However, fantasy managers can't afford to have Ekeler on the bench for the championship week of most leagues. He'll be a slightly more risky RB1 play than usual this week.\u00a0\n",

Harris' rushing line was extra impressive in the context of the Pats spending much of the afternoon down two scores. Touchdown No. 1 was a 16-yarder where Harris took a flip and flattened the defense near the goal line. No. 2 featured a nice little cutback, and No. 3 was all about second effort. Harris' Week 17 ranking against the Jaguars will depend on Stevenson's availability, but he will be in the top 24 regardless.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Aside from ceding a goal-line series to Zack Moss in the second quarter, it was a complete afternoon for Singletary with Matt Breida out as a healthy scratch. Singletary, whose score was a two-yarder in the final frame, has now taken complete control of what had turned into a three-man committee. It is just in time for a laughably easy season-ending pair of games in the Falcons and Jets. Although we can never be for certain with anything when it comes to OC Brian Daboll's running back usage, it would seem all involved are happy with the simplified approach, and that Singletary will see enough Week 17 handles to sneak into the top 24 at running back.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Penny was once again a rare bright spot for a team that has become one of the toughest watches in the NFL. The 135 rushing yards were the second most of Penny's career, and only two off his new high-water mark from Week 14. Penny isn't just churning out yardage, but chunk yardage, making big plays for a backfield where that had not been a thing for months. He still has zero role in the passing game, and is a bit boom-or-bust, but the fact there is a \"boom\" is something new for the 2018 first-round bust. It has reached the point with Penny where it doesn't matter who else is healthy in this backfield, Penny is going to lead it. He has plus Week 17 and 18 matchups in vs. DET, @AZ, respectively.\u00a0\n",

That doesn't explain the fact that Dontrell Hilliard started, however, handling the Titans' first two snaps of the night. There wasn't much rhyme or reason to the usage, though Foreman was the only Titan to find the end zone on the ground. He was cannon shot on his three-yard score in the third quarter. Pro Football Focus charted Foreman, Hilliard and Jeremy McNichols all playing 5-9 of the Titans' 23 first half plays. We will get more data in the coming days, but it's unlikely to shine much of a light on things. After looking like he had taken control of the Titans' backfield, Foreman is now back to risky FLEX for Week 17 vs. the Dolphins.\u00a0\n",

Mike Davis, Zack Moss, and Latavius Murray are among the backs with the league's lowest rush yards over expected per attempt through Week 16. Hubbard has little fantasy appeal in the horrid Carolina offense, and could see competition for the No. 2 spot behind Christian McCaffrey next season.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Wilson's touchdown was a true one-yard goal-line plunge to cap the 49ers' perfect opening drive. He got another shot in the fourth quarter but was held to a four-yard gain on 1st-and-goal from the Titans' six. Brandon Aiyuk caught a touchdown pass the next play. Wilson's lack of establishment was surprising in a game where the Niners headed into halftime up 10-0, but a shaky Jimmy Garoppolo was killing drives with turnovers and missed gimmes. Rhythm never returned for San Fran. The question for Wilson now becomes if Elijah Mitchell returns for Week 17 against the Texans, though Mitchell appeared nowhere close to suiting up this week. If Mitchell remains sidelined, Wilson will be impossible to keep out of the top 20 vs. Houston's defense.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

However, he's difficult to trust as an RB2, given that Patterson is far more explosive and the Falcons know it.\n",

That TD came on a play where the Browns hit Rodgers with an all-out blitz, which also shouldn't happen, but here we are. Rodgers floated the ball up to Adams for an easy TD. He then found Adams for a one-yard TD on an out route two drives later. Adams also showed off his connection with Rodgers on a ridiculously precisely timed back-shoulder throw and catch. Adams' worst moment of the game came on a dropped pass on 3rd-and-6 near the end of the game. The ball hit Adams in the hands, but he had to fully extend while running full speed. It was a tough catch, but one he usually makes. Adams will remain an elite WR1 against the Vikings in Week 17.\n",

Thankfully, he returned without incident both times. He will probably need his practice reps rationed this week, though. Grinding through this season instead of soaring like he did in 2020, Diggs has a soft pair of season-ending matchups in home dates with the Falcons and Jets.\u00a0\n",

The flipside was that he finally\u00a0progressed\u00a0as a receiver, reverting to his big-play, compiling ways from the first half of the season. The double-digit target performance was his first since Week 7, with the 100-yard game through the air his first since Week 8. The highlight was a fourth quarter, 56-yard catch-and-run where Samuel roasted\u00a0Kristian Fulton. He did come down hard at the end of the play, taking several minutes to regain his breath. That is our only concern with Samuel's second-half-of-the-season usage, as coach Kyle Shanahan is putting him in position to get\u00a0hit.\u00a0Samuel is taking far more contact than the average wideout. It seems like it will be difficult for him to hold up, but he mostly has so far, missing only one contest. Samuel will remain an all-purpose fantasy X factor for Week 17 against the rebuilding Texans.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Brown's usage as a short-area pass target hog continued with Josh Johnson under center for Baltimore. It's fair to question whether Brown -- once a preeminent downfield threat -- has access to a fantasy ceiling in the current iteration of the Ravens offense. Brown hasn't cracked the 60-yard mark since Week 9 despite seeing massive volume week in and week out. Fantasy managers can treat him as a low-end WR2 option in PPR leagues next week against the Rams.\u00a0\n",

He was the only starting Tampa Bay receiver healthy for this game but wasn\u2019t fazed by the extra attention. His 15 targets were good for a gaudy, 50-percent target share. No other wide receiver saw more than three targets. Boosted by Brady\u2019s precision, Brown doesn\u2019t appear to have lost a step since his prime in Pittsburgh. He got the better of Stephon Gilmore on multiple occasions this week and will clock in as WR1 once again in Week 17.\n",

Moore. The Texans are pulling through a rough COVID outbreak, as are many other teams. The return of Cooks gives Davis Mills a reliable receiver and his best play-maker back. With Mills looking better in recent weeks, Cooks projects as WR2 heading into Week 17.\n",

It all clicked in the second half, with the highlights being Brown's 42-yard gain over\u00a0Ambry Thomas on a free play and his shaking and baking of Josh Norman near the goal line for an 18-yard score. Brown and Ryan Tannehill left some meat on the bone with imperfect Tannehill throws, but fantasy managers who have survived this long will not be complaining. Brown has a tough Week 17 assignment in the Dolphins before a curtain-closing affair with the Texans.\u00a0\n",

Odell Beckham only saw two more targets than Jefferson but did get open for a seven-yard touchdown in the second half. Los Angeles' primary deep threat, Jefferson will remain a strong WR3 neck-and-neck with Beckham for Week 17.\n",

Lazard had a chance for a second TD but dropped nine-yard TD that hit him in the hands. Outside of his TD, it was a fairly quiet day. Although, Lazard did have another nice reception from with Rodgers down the sideline in one on one coverage that looked like a Rodger-to-Adams connection. Lazard will be a FLEX option against the Vikings in Week 17.\n",

    "analysis": "Jeudy bounced back from his catch-less Week 15 but it came almost entirely on one play. The Raiders lost Jeudy on a play-action play from Denver and he was left wide open, resulting in a 40-yard catch. It was an otherwise uneventful day for him. The offense struggled in Drew Lock's first start and Jeudy was out-targeted 5-4 by Courtland Sutton. He enters Week 17 as a WR4.\n",

With Tim Boyle under center this week, St. Brown made it clear that he's not simply a product of Jared Goff's affinity for the slot. He even got involved as a rusher with two rushes for 19 yards. The rookie also go in the end zone on a nice leaping grab where he immediately spun around and got upfield for the score. St. Brown will be a WR2/3 regardless of who is at quarterback for Week 17 against the Seahawks.\n",

    "analysis": "Higgins got whatever he wanted to get against an injury-riddled Baltimore secondary. Joe Burrow found his No. 1 wideout repeatedly on the boundaries with the Ravens defense guarding against downfield splash plays. Burrow in the second half lobbed one to Higgins in double coverage; he came down with it for a 52-yard gain on a day that saw Burrow pass for a gaudy 525 yards. Since the beginning of November, Higgins has a higher target share, a higher air yards share, and has been more efficient with his targets than teammate Ja'Marr Chase. When the Bengals commit to a pass-first approach -- as they did in both 2021 matchups against Baltimore -- they are close to unstoppable. Higgins will be a WR1 in Week 17 against a tough Kansas City defense.\u00a0\n",

Davis' role is a bit uncertain with Emmanuel Sanders and Cole Beasley both returning to the lineup. It also doesn't help that\u00a0Isaiah McKenzie may force his way onto the field for snaps from the slot. Davis has a chance of usurping Emmanuel Sanders' role on the outside, but it's also possible he plays a rotational role in the fantasy championship round.\n",

Lil'Jordan Humphrey led the team in targets with five and receiving with a 3-70 line thanks to a meaningless 56-yard catch-and-run late in the fourth quarter. Callaway has exactly four targets in six of the last seven games. The exception was a 6-112 outlier against the Bucs in Week 15. Callaway is a WR5 headed into a Week 17 date with the Panthers. He went 2-8-0 on four targets across 73% of the snaps against Carolina way back in Week 2.\n",

    "analysis": "Collins was the Texans' No. 1 receiver with Brandin Cooks sidelined. The rookie scored his first career touchdown on a game-sealing catch late in the fourth quarter that set Houston up for the win.\u00a0Collins has been slowed by injuries and bad quarterback play, but he's started to heat up with at least 60 yards or a touchdown two of the last three weeks. The Texans have a matchup with the 49ers in Week 17.\n",

Absolutely on fire in the month of December entering this evening, Kittle crashed back down to earth as Jimmy Garoppolo seemed to develop the yips following an awful finish to the first half. That included a first quarter end zone interception where Kittle was the intended target. Jimmy stared him down for approximately 45 minutes of real time before throwing the ball right to Jackrabbit Jenkins. Astonishingly, Garoppolo proceeded to target Kittle zero more times the rest of the night. That's not good for anybody. If you can survive this in your fantasy league, you will be rewarded with a Week 17 date with the Texans.\u00a0\n",

Despite the team missing Mike Evans and Chris Godwin for this game, Gronk was out-targeted by Cameron Brate, who also found the end zone. Tom Brady locked onto Antonio Brown, throwing to him on half of his throws, and all other Tampa Bay pass-catchers were forced to fight for the scraps. With the Bucs missing their top two receivers, it's hard to believe this usage will continue in Week 17. Gronk can still be trusted as a TE1 next week.\n",

    "analysis": "Higbee continued his streak with at least five targets in every game Odell Beckham has been available for. Even so, the former is still considered a boom-or-bust option since he has not recorded 60 receiving yards since Week 1 and has only scored three touchdowns all year. He should be treated as such again in Week 17.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Knox gave fantasy managers a heart attack with the low-volume performance, but eventually got home with a fourth quarter score after having one called back in the third due to an ineligible man down field. For the touchdown that Knox did convert, he took a simple flip from an adlibbing Josh Allen. The lack of targets were disappointing on an afternoon where Cole Beasley and Gabriel Davis were sidelined, but Knox will remain a big-play/touchdown-based TE1 for Week 17 against the Falcons.\u00a0\n",

Initial testing on the injured knee showed MCL damage but did not reveal a torn ACL. Ricky Seals-Jones should be the Football Team's primary pass-catching tight end for the season's remaining four weeks, with John Bates mixing in now and again. In Week 14 against the Cowboys, Bates actually ran more pass routes than Seals-Jones. Neither are solid fantasy options in the low-volume Washington offense.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Everett, for whatever reason, was the Seahawks' leading receiver this afternoon. His 24-yard score in the third quarter came on a play fake where he leaked out and worked himself free near the goal line. This being Everett, he also committed an unbelievably damaging false start penalty on 4th-and-1 with 0:31 remaining, but that won't hurt fantasy managers' scores. A weekly favorite of Russell Wilson's despite his error-prone ways, Everett has a plus Week 17 matchup in the Lions.\u00a0\n",

Despite that, he's off the fantasy radar in 1-TE leagues, especially with a matchup against a decent Steelers defense on tap in Week 15.\n",

Callahan, meanwhile, has a strange fascination with five Bengals pass catchers recording 50 grabs this season. The Athletic's Jay Morrison said Joe Burrow \"established an immediate connection\" with Uzomah in 2020, as the tight end saw five targets in Week 1 and six looks in Week 2 before going down with a season-ending Achilles injury in the first half. Drew Sample started the rest of the season for Cincinnati and ran the 12th most tight end routes on his way to a miserable 4.9 PPR points per game. Uzomah, 28, has been fully cleared and is expected to be a full go for training camp. He should be a popular late-round target in the Bengals' pass-heavy offense.\u00a0\n",

Kmet almost had a score of his own in the fourth quarter but couldn't get his feet in bounds. Kmet has cleared 40 yards in four of his past five games, but he has still yet to find the end zone this season, killing any chance he has had at graduating to TE1 status. For Week 17 Kmet will get a faded Giants team that has a decent defense but hemorrhages opponent play volume because of its offensive ineptitude, keeping Kmet in the targets-based TE2 mix.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Patterson (5\u201910/181) was a three-star prospect that was rated as the 16th best kicker from the 2017 prep class. The Edwardsville, IL native struggled a bit as a freshman, converting 69 percent of his field goals while registering only two touchbacks on 24 kickoffs. However, Patterson showed consistent year-over-year improvement throughout his career, boosting his conversion rate to 75 percent in 2018 and 92 percent in 2019. In addition to his on-point accuracy, Patterson converted five-of-six attempts of 50 or more yards two seasons ago. His production slipped a bit in 2020, making 15-of-22 attempts, but five of those misses came from beyond the 50-yard threshold, so that should be accounted for. Though he doesn\u2019t possess the most imposing leg in the class, his touchback rate was decent, as 38-of-63 kickoffs were not returned. He will need to iron out his conversion rate if he is going to stick around at the NFL level. The Vikings only have one other kicker rostered, third-year boot Greg Joseph, who has just 20 career field goal attempts. Expect a true kicking completion to take place between Joseph and Patterson if the Vikings don't bring in anyone else.\n",

Santos is not called on very often from 50-plus yards, making him an extra unlikely recipient of this kind of contract. There's a chance this deal could quickly become an albatross.\u00a0\n",

McPherson is the favorite in the team's kicker competition with veteran Austin Seibert, who has also impressed coaches and beat writers this month. The Bengals offense is among the league's most kicker friendly. Last season, Randy Bullock was fantasy's third highest scoring kicker when Joe Burrow went down with a season-ending knee injury. Fantasy managers should consider McPherson if the game's top kickers are off the draft board.\u00a0\n",

Tucker's heroics saved the Ravens on a day that saw Marquise Brown drop three touchdowns and Baltimore struggle to get anything going on the ground against a middling Detroit front seven. Tucker has made all 16 of his field goal tries in the final minute of the game over his nine seasons in Baltimore. Tucker doesn't have the fantasy upside he had with the Flacco-era Ravens, but he's still an every-week play in 12-team formats.\u00a0\n",

    "headlineNews": "Dolphins signed kicker Jason Sanders to a five-year contract extension worth $22 million.\u00a0\n",
    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Fantasy football's No. 2 kicker in 2020 is cashing in on a profoundly efficient season in which he made 36 of 39 field goal attempts, banging through all 36 of his extra point tries. He established himself as one of the league's big-footed kickers by nailing eight of nine kickers over 50 yards. Sanders' extension includes a $10 million guarantee. His 2020 numbers stand in stark contrast to his 2019 stats, which include seven missed field goals on 30 attempts. Only the Cowboys and Falcons attempted more field goals than Miami in 2020, giving Sanders the opportunity necessary to become a waiver wire darling in fantasy. Sanders will probably be one of the most over-drafted kickers in fantasy football next season.\u00a0\n",

He was inactive in Week 5 against the Dolphins and backup kicker Matthew Wright drilled all three of his field goal tries, including a game-winning kick that temporarily relieved Urban Meyer's suffering. Lambo was once among the league's most accurate kickers, making 71 of his 75 field goal tries (94.6 percent) from 2017 to 2019. Wright shouldn't be considered a reliable fantasy option on a Jacksonville team that generates almost no positive game script. Lambo, meanwhile, has a good shot of landing on another team as a fill-in kicker.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Rapoport added, \"It figures to be a challenge for him to play this weekend.\" The Ravens have been decimated by injuries in their secondary this year and the list keeps growing. That has forced Averett into an every-down role and he's played well given the less-than-ideal circumstances. Averett has 11 pass defenses and three interceptions on the year. Like Aaron Rodgers and Joe Burrow before him, Matthew Stafford projects to pick apart Baltimore this week.\n",
