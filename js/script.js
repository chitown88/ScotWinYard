Goff hit Quintez Cephus on a 46-yard bomb on the opening drive before capping it off with his big wideout for a five-yard touchdown a couple plays later. Goff then found T.J. Hockenson on a beautiful eight-yard touchdown in the second quarter. Goff was on fire in the opening half but then fumbled the ball twice in the second half and tossed a horrendous pick late in the fourth quarter. It's the Goff we saw way too much of in L.A. that frustrated Sean McVay. Goff has five touchdowns through two games but has two picks and a couple fumbles. He won't be a recommended fantasy play Week 3 against the Ravens.\n",

It was also the second straight game with at least four touchdowns for Murray, who has scorched his favorable opening matchups for 33 fantasy points in back-to-back weeks.

The Giants then, unsurprisingly, settled for a field goal. For the rushing score he did convert, Jones cashed in a quarterback draw. As a passer, Jones was under siege in the first half before finding more time after the break. He nearly turned it into a 43-yard touchdown strike to Darius Slayton, but the receiver could not corral a ball thrown inches too far. It will be labeled a drop, but it should have been a better pass. The touchdown Jones did convert was a 33-yard strike to Slayton in the third frame, where the wideout simply ran by William Jackson III. Elsewhere, Jones' timing looked off with Kenny Golladay, and the high-dollar free agent addition was spotted yelling at Jones on the sideline. He had a point. Jones has 10 days to lick his wounds before a golden matchup in the Falcons. Up to 122 yards rushing through two starts, Jones is punching way above his weight as a fantasy option. It will be hard to keep him out of the QB1 streamer mix for Week 3.\u00a0\n",

His touchdown was a nicely-thrown ball to Deebo Samuel down the right side that Samuel took 79 yards to the house. Averaging a monstrous 12.6 yards per attempt should quiet the Lance crowd for at least a week ahead of a Week 2 date with the Eagles. Garoppolo is not a fantasy recommendation on such low pass volume.\n",

Albeit a sluggish second half, Cousins got the ball back with 2:09 remaining then drove Minnesota's offense 58 yards down the field only to watch Greg Joseph push the game-winning field goal try wide right from 37 yards out. Cousins doesn't typically offer a rushing floor but he has quietly thrown multiple touchdown passes in 10 of his last 11 starts dating back to last year.

Last year, Allen completed 62.5 percent of his attempts between 10 and 25 yards beyond the line of scrimmage -- a 12 percent improvement over his 2019 numbers. \"This has been, by far, the most significant swing of Allen\u2019s passing profile,\" said The Athletic's Joe Buscaglia. \"While some throwaways need to be accounted for, this is still not what you want to see.\" Allen's adjusted completion rate, as measured by Pro Football Focus, has also dipped in the young 2021 season. His adjusted completion rate stands at 69.4 percent, about 10 percent lower than his 2020 rate. The results of his early-season passing regression are evident in his fantasy output. Allen is the QB19 through Week 2.\u00a0\n",

Darnold was consistently posting chunk gains through the air this evening, notching six conversions of 20-plus yards. In the \"what might have been?\" category, Darnold had a 33-yard run called back by holding and overshot D.J. Moore on a potential 51-yard touchdown. Darnold's production has come against the softest of schedules, but it's not like big numbers in good spots could be taken for granted when he was in New York. He is passing every test so far, mostly avoiding turnover-worthy plays, locking onto scintillating fourth-year pro Moore, and even showing juice on the ground, where he now has three scores. The Cowboys will be his toughest test thus far in Week 4, but not from a defensive perspective. Darnold will finally be forced to match scores with someone. That is where mistakes start to get made. He will find himself on the QB1/2 borderline.\n",

    "analysis": "Aside from one second half stretch where he was under constant pressure, Brady rained destruction on the Falcons' hapless defense, finding each of Mike Evans and Rob Gronkowski for two scores before capping things off with a fifth to Chris Godwin. Brady was simply playing pitch and catch, frequently finding his targets wide open at the intermediate level of the field. The only Bucs pass catcher not to get in on the fun was Antonio Brown, who had a big potential gain disrupted by CB A.J. Terrell. Brady's arm appears a tad stronger than it did in 2020, while the Bucs' offense has looked close to unstoppable over its past 8-10 games. The party will be put to the test in a Week 3 road date with Aaron Donald/Jalen Ramsey's Rams.\u00a0\n",

He didn't register his first incompletion until the 11:54 mark in the second quarter, flailing an underthrown pass to Courtland Sutton (9/159) downfield. Teddy eventually closed the half\u00a015-of-21 for 184 yards and one score, finding Tim Patrick (3/37/1) for a 12-yard touchdown to give Denver a 10-7 lead at the half. Noah Fant's (4/33/1) score to open the third quarter was all Denver needed to seal this one early. Given his (surprising) aggressiveness through the air thus far, Bridgewater will arguably make for a high-end QB2 in next week's matchup against the injury-riddled Jets.\n",

Jacksonville's offense has struggled mightily in its first two games of the Lawrence era outside an impressive opening Week 2 drive against the Broncos. Lawrence and the Jags will once again be forced into pass-heavy game script this week against Arizona. Lawrence should only be deployed in superflex formats for now.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Herbert posted a solid fantasy outing but his day could have been monstrous were it not for a few mistakes. He had two touchdowns called back by penalties and one of his interceptions came in end zone. The Chargers also had a pair of drives end in red zone field goals. A lot of things broke against Herbert and he still topped 300 yards and found paydirt once. For an off day, that's pretty good. Los Angeles has dialed up 88 pass attempts for him through two games and he's been willing to go deep frequently. All of this points to gaudy yardage totals and plenty of touchdown potential in the future. Look for a bounceback performance from the second-year passer in his Week 3 outing versus the Chiefs.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Making his first career start, the No. 67 overall pick absorbed one bone-crushing hit after another, taking four sacks and nine hits by FOX's count. It was frankly unclear how Mills got up from several of his knocks, especially in the second half as the Panthers pinned their ears back. The box score says Mills committed zero turnovers, but he plainly fumbled in the fourth quarter. Somehow, some way, it was ruled an incomplete pass. He tried to put the ball on the ground several other times. Predictably, the Texans weren't letting Mills so much as look down the field before falling behind by two scores after the break. Mills wasn't awful with the restrictor plate off, finding Brandin Cooks for a few nice gains. The problem is, Cooks remains the Texans' only weapon. Mills has another brutal Week 4 matchup in the Bills, where he will offer zero DFS or streaming appeal.\u00a0\n",

Three of Rodgers' four scores were four-, one-, and 11-yard hookups with Aaron Jones with the fourth going to Robert Tonyan. Rodgers also got Davante Adams back involved with an 8-121 line on a team-high nine looks. Rodgers actually left some big plays out there, missing Marquez Valdes-Scantling on a number of deep shots where he beat the cornerback over the top. Rodgers will get a tough Week 3 road test at the 49ers.\n",

Nagy can say all he wants right now but if Fields looks like the real deal is his time as the starter, it will be hard for him to pull the rookie from the starting lineup. Nick Foles will serve as the backup to Fields this week. With his immense rushing upside, Fields can be slotted in as a borderline QB1 in his debut.\n",

Two of his picks were housed for six points, devastating a nascent Falcons comeback attempt in the second half. The miscues came in the span of four minutes, with one ricocheting off a defensive lineman's hands and the other coming on a jumped route. Ryan once again had trouble finding top weapons Kyle Pitts and Calvin Ridley for big plays, though both compiled more than they did in the opener. Ryan has almost no athleticism left behind a horrid offensive line. This is going to get worse before it gets better, which may be never. The Giants are a potentially problematic Week 3 road date, though Taylor Heinicke had little trouble with the G-Men in Week 2.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Making his second career regular season start,\u00a0Heinicke got over some early nerves \u2014 his first two drives went nowhere, with the Football Team's wideouts having to leave their feet on nearly every pass attempt \u2014 to settle in and do what the coaching staff wanted him to do: Relentlessly target Terry McLaurin and J.D. McKissic. Fantasy managers might disagree on the latter point, but McKissic provided the biggest play of the game with a 56-yard sideline reception in the fourth quarter, while McLaurin came up with one monster grab after another following the break.\u00a0Heinicke's ball placement isn't the greatest the NFL has ever seen, but it was better than replacement-level this evening, just as it was in the Wild Card Round. He did nearly throw the game away with a horrific fourth quarter pick on a pass that should have never left his hands. Either way, it's possible Heinicke is the best quarterback on the Football Team's roster. They will have more than a month to find out with Ryan Fitzpatrick out 6-8 weeks with a hip injury. There are going to be valleys for a journeyman like\u00a0Heinicke, but we have already gotten peaks that could not have been taken for granted. The Bills represent a stiff Week 3 road test, keeping\u00a0Heinicke merely in superflex territory.\u00a0\n",

Having no established targets hierarchy and shaky protection against a thundering Panthers front seven, Winston was utterly abysmal, with both his interceptions the kind of bone-headed throws he was routinely mocked for in Tampa. INT No. 1 was a desperation heave falling backward that landed in a crowd of three Panthers. No. 2 came after Winston climbed the pocket and blindly chucked the ball down the field. Payton is going to be livid watching the film. Despite Winston's negative play, Taysom Hill mixed in for only two touches. Winston has maybe the worst potential Week 3 bounce-back spot in a road trip to New England.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "The rookie rushed three times for 19 yards and absorbed four sacks on a day to forget. Wilson's first two passes of the game were picked off on some really poor throws/decisions. At one point deep into the first half, Wilson had completed three passes to Jets players and three to Patriots defenders. He could have easily thrown six or seven picks in this one. Simply put, Wilson was trying to make things happen and wasn't taking what the defense was giving him. He was trying to push the ball down the field. It's just a day to forget for the rookie. And that happens to first-year quarterbacks facing Bill Belichick's defenses. Wilson gets another brutal Week 3 date when the Jets go to Denver.\n",

Jacoby Brissett -- disastrous Sunday in Tua's place -- would get the nod against the Raiders if\u00a0Tagovailoa is sidelined. Every fantasy relevant Miami player would be downgraded and the Raiders surprisingly good defense would become a must-start option in Week 3.

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Mike Zimmer's comments earlier in the week seemed to indicate that Cook will be in for a full workload if he can go. If so, Cook will be set up for a big week in a high total game, despite his injury risk. If Cook is ruled out, Alexander Mattison becomes very interesting, though there is risk that he loses receiving work to Ameer Abdullah. The Vikings play in the late afternoon window, so fantasy managers will need to have a contingency plan in place in case Cook is ruled out on Sunday.\n",

It's an unexpected role change for Henry, and one that could give him the PPR upside that he's sorely lacked during his dominant rushing years. The Big Dog caught all six of his Week 2 targets against the Seahawks, though fantasy managers can't expect that kind of fantasy-friendly back-and-forth game script to unfold every week. A horrid Titans defense, however, could force the offense to push the pace. It's possible Darrynton Evans' (knee) return from injured reserve near the end of September could scale back Henry's pass-game involvement.\n",

    "analysis": "Carson handled 13-of-14 carries out of the backfield but wasn't targeted in the passing game. However, Carson did save his fantasy day with a pair of short touchdowns from one and two yards out in the second quarter. Carson has absolutely dominated backfield work through two weeks. He's a borderline RB1/2 headed into a Week 3 date with the Vikings.\n",

The Patriots have the Saints in Week 3, and New Orleans has allowed only 2.8 yards per carry early on and were one of the best teams in that category in 2020 as well. If you somehow lucked into better options, you might consider fading Harris this week, but the workload should be there for him to be in the low RB2 range.\u00a0\n",

Even if he plays he's likely to split some early down carries with Sony Michel and cede some third downs to Jake Funk. With how high scoring the Rams game against the Buccaneers could be, Henderson will still be interesting if he goes. Fantasy managers will need a backup option in place however, because the game is in the late afternoon window. If Henderson misses, Michel is likely to handle the vast majority of carries with Funk working in for third downs.\n",

    "analysis": "This is a new listing for Sanders, but the limited tag this early in the week isn't a cause for concern just yet. If for whatever reason Sanders were to miss Week 3's MNF tilt with Dallas, it would be a big elevation for Kenneth Gainwell's stock. For now, with two days of practice left for the Eagles, it remains a situation worth monitoring rather than something that should send Sanders' managers scrambling for solutions.\u00a0\n",

Barkley played 84% of snaps in Week 2, and should be in another 80%+ workload on Sunday. If so, Barkley will have regained the high volume role that he had prior to going down with injury in 2020. Barkley hasn't been as involved as a receiver as he has in the past, despite his high snap count in Week 2. Coming off 10 days of rest, he could be a bigger part of the game plan this week.\u00a0\n",

The Saints simply have zero reliable targets beyond Kamara, and it was not difficult for the Panthers to diagnose what was happening on any given snap. It was still surprising to see Kamara limited to eight carries one week after he reached 20 for only the second time in his career. The Saints have a lot to work through ahead of next Sunday's foreboding New England road trip. Despite today's disaster, Kamara remains a cinch RB1 as a game-proof player who will be funneled all of his team's most important touches.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "The Jaguars have breached the red zone once through Week 2. NFL teams have combined for 266 rushing attempts in the red zone through two weeks, according to ESPN's Mike Clay. A dozen teams have at least ten runs in the red zone. Jacksonville's dead-on-arrival offense has yet to attempt a single run inside the 20 -- one of the early season's most remarkable stats. James Robinson has out-rushed Carlos Hyde 16 to 11 through two weeks while taking on most of the pass-catching duties out of the backfield. Jacksonville's offense -- predictable and constantly trailing -- might not offer much in the way of running back production this year. Robinson is barely a flex option in 14-team leagues.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Ingram has now seen his carries decline from 26 to 14 to tonight's dismal number as the Texans' offense has predictably (further) collapsed without Tyrod Taylor under center. Rookie fill-in Davis Mills neither sustained drives nor commanded respect from the Panthers' defense, creating limited overall volume and zero advantageous running situations. The setup is not going to improve in a Week 4 road trip to Buffalo, where Ingram will be a \"pray for a one-yard touchdown\" RB4/FLEX.\u00a0\n",

Pollard has looked more explosive than Elliott through two games and the Cowboys have been more comfortable splitting their backfield than in previous years. It's still hard to trust Pollard as a standalone fantasy option but his share of the backfield is turning Elliott into a volatile RB2 instead of the elite option drafters were hoping for. If the split continues, Pollard will emerge as a viable FLEX option whenever the Cowboys find themselves in negative game scripts.\u00a0\n",

The Vikings play in the late afternoon window, so fantasy managers will need to have a contingency plan in place in case Cook is ruled out on Sunday.\n",

Barber could have fleeting fantasy usefulness next week against the Dolphins if Jacobs is once again out.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "HC Sean McVay elaborated on Henderson's availability, saying it would \"depend on pain tolerance.\" Henderson had an every down role prior to departing in Week 2. Even if he plays he's likely to split some early down carries with Sony Michel and cede some third downs to Jake Funk. With how high scoring the Rams game against the Buccaneers could be, Henderson will still be interesting if he goes. Fantasy managers will need a backup option in place however, because the game is in the late afternoon window. If Henderson misses, Michel is likely to handle the vast majority of carries with Funk working in for third downs.\n",

Mike Williams has been more involved early in the year but the Chargers' pass-heavy approach has created more than enough volume for both receivers and Austin Ekeler to excel. Through two weeks, LA has passed 88 times and ran the ball 48 times. In a projected loss to Kansas City next week, we can expect to see a similar philosophy from Los Angeles. Allen can be penciled in as a WR1 going forward.\n",

Cooks is providing some of his best ball in the worst circumstances of his career. The Bills' tough pass defense might finally bring an end to the compiling party in Week 4, but Cooks is clearly an every-week WR3 making a case for WR2 treatment.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Hopkins missed all three days of practice this week, so his Week 3 status appears to be in genuine doubt. If Hopkins were to miss the game it would likely mean more outside snaps for Christian Kirk and an expanded role in the slot for rookie sensation Rondale Moore. If Hopkins can suit up he'll be worth the risk in a great matchup that could be very fast paced. The Cardinals play in the early window on Sunday so fantasy managers will be able to wait for Sunday inactives to make a decision.\n",

The rookie has been a deep threat this season and could benefit from taking on more of Higgins' intermediate target role.

Hurts was erratic in Week 2 and underthrew Smith on a long ball but the volume is tantalizing. In a softer matchup with Dallas next week, Smith can be comfortably viewed as a WR3.\n",

    "analysis": "Jones led the team in targets by a significant margin, accruing 11 to Laviska Shenault's seven (for -3 yards). Jones actually recorded 4/49/1 on the team's opening drive, capping that possession with a 25-yard score, but recorded just six more yards from that point forward as Trevor Lawrence passed for 47 yards over the last three quarters. The Jaguars have only been successful on offense when D.J. Chark (1/19) and Jones have won their one-on-one matchups downfield, which is expected to continue into next week's uptempo show against Arizona. Consider Jones a high-floor WR3 in that matchup.\n",

Fuller has enough talent to warrant FLEX consideration, but Brissett is coming off a very rough outing against the Bills and will now face an even tougher matchup. Fuller will likely need to hit a big play or two to generate fantasy value this week.\n",

Moore has 2.69 YPRR this season, this third straight season with elite per route efficiency. Anderson can at least get back into the WR3 mix with more target volume.\n",

    "headlineNews": "Courtland Sutton caught 9-of-12 targets for 159 yards in Denver's Week 2 win over the Jaguars.\n",
    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Only one week after he accrued an 8% target share with a single catch, Sutton returned to his vintage form, accruing a career-high 12 targets (35%) and leaping for 55- and 34-yard grabs at the point of catch downfield. Teddy Bridgewater also missed Sutton streaking with a shade of separation for what would have been the latter's first touchdown of the year. Tim Patrick (3/37/1) and K.J. Hamler (1/5) combined for seven targets in place of Jerry Jeudy (ankle), but Sutton's over-the-top prowess was clearly the backup plan against Jacksonville's failed man-to-man scheme. With his injury clearly a thing of the past, Sutton will arguably rank as a low-end WR2 in Week 3 against the Jets.\n",

Ridley's touchdown was a diving three-yarder on 4th-and-goal where he got a step on Ross Cockrell. Matt Ryan's inability to find Ridley for more than 12/114 through two contests looks curious in the box scores, but less so in the context of Ryan's molasses athleticism behind Atlanta's awful line. The connection will nevertheless heat up, perhaps as early as Week 3 against a Giants defense fresh off getting roasted by Terry McLaurin.\u00a0\n",

He'll be eligible to return in Week 6 against the Eagles if cleared from the league's protocol and at full strength by that time. Quintez Cephus has stepped in for Williams of late, accruing 12 targets \u2014 the most among Detroit's wide receivers \u2014 over the last five quarters. He remains a thin FLEX option that could continue to provide value in garbage time.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Slayton's touchdown was a 33-yarder where he ran right by William Jackson III. He could have had an even bigger night after coming open for a would-be 43-yard score on a blown coverage, but he committed a \"drop\" on a Daniel Jones pass that was ever so slightly overthrown. Both were to blame. Slayton struggled with drops in Week 1, though he has so far remained Jones' preferred deep target even with Kenny Golladay on the roster. The Falcons' talent-less defense is on tap for Week 3.\u00a0\n",

Patrick trailed Courtland Sutton (12 targets) and Noah Fant (6) in targets from Bridgewater but still out-performed K.J.

Fill-in starter Taylor Heinicke decided on a McLaurin-or-bust strategy after a quiet first quarter and McLaurin responded with one critical chain-moving grab after another. He is far and away the most important weapon in this passing attack, and Heinicke was able to make that critical determination on only three days' rest coming out of his Week 1 relief appearance. The duo should continue to hook up for a targets bonanza, stabilizing McLaurin's WR1 value. He does face a stiff Week 3 test in Tre'Davious White and the Bills.\u00a0\n",

Lamb and Cooper will trade off high-volume games regularly and both hold WR1 upside every week. Both players should be started as fantasy WR2s versus the Eagles in Week 3.\n",

    "analysis": "So much for regression. Thielen's touchdown, his third of the year and 17th in as many games dating back to last season, occurred inside the 10-yard line where Kirk Cousins has grown to trust him most. His seven targets finished second on the team behind Justin Jefferson's (6/65/1), though fifth-round rookie K.J. Osborn (5/91/1) out-produced both. With an increased amount of 11 personnel sans Irv Smith this year, Minnesota's wide receiver production has become a game of weekly whack-a-mole from Cousins. Even so, Thielen will again be ranked as a WR2/3 for it against Seattle next week.\n",

Aaron Rodgers threw four touchdowns in this one, but three went to Aaron Jones in the red zone, and the fourth was a 22-yarder to Robert Tonyan.

The \"limited\" tags suggest he will have a shot to suit up vs. Tennessee, but we lack a Week 2 baseline to operate off of since he was a late addition. Even if Campbell does suit up, it will be to a nightmare quarterback situation without Carson Wentz, removing him from any Week 3 consideration, DFS or otherwise.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Osborn put the Vikings on the board first, separating for a 64-yard touchdown on play-action to take a 7-0 lead behind his first career score. The fifth-round rookie also came up big late, making a diving catch on the team's final drive to put Greg Joseph in position for a (missed) 37-yard field goal. Osborne quietly leads Minnesota in receiving yards through two games (167), likely convincing coach Mike Zimmer to continue using 11 personnel as the team's base package moving forward. Osborn should (surprisingly) be considered a real WR4/5 threat for deeper leagues, especially in Week 3 against Seattle.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Anderson has just 11 targets through three games while D.J. Moore has 31. Drafted at a slight discount to Moore this off-season, Anderson has been several ballpark's removed from Moore's target share. Anderson has been effective when targeted with a 9.4 YPT, and involving him more makes sense to keep defenses honest. He's unlikely to be able to slow down Moore's breakout, however. Moore has 2.69 YPRR this season, this third straight season with elite per route efficiency. Anderson can at least get back into the WR3 mix with more target volume.\n",

The protection wasn't amazing while the Panthers' defensive line was, but the biggest problem was probably the Saints' lack of a targets hierarchy. Winston simply has no clue who to turn to at any given moment, and Callaway is not forcing the issue after his strong summer and preseason. He now has three grabs on six targets through two contests, and has a dreadful Week 3 road matchup in the Patriots. Fantasy managers hard up for roster spots could already make a drop call, but Callaway is probably worth riding out for another week or two if you don't have an acute need. Someone has to catch passes in this offense, and Michael Thomas remains at least a month away.\u00a0\n",

His 109 yards led the Chiefs in receiving and he tied Mecole Hardman with eight targets. Kelce has picked up where he left off last year, posting a 13/185/3 line through two games. The six-time Pro Bowler gets a matchup with the Chargers secondary in Week 3.\n",

Pitts tallied two separate 24-yard catches in the second frame. We need to see more targets, but Pitts' usage is leaving nothing to be desired. He is being treated as a movable chess piece by rookie head coach Arthur Smith.

Still, this is the second game that Deebo Samuel has seen more targets than him. Our sample size this year is minimal but a larger role for Samuel could result in fewer weekly targets for Kittle. Even if that is the case, no one is benching Kittle anytime soon. He should be in line for a bounceback performance against the Packers next week.\n",

The continued drumbeat on Granson makes him a very intriguing dynasty target. In 2021\u00a0though, Colts split\u00a0snaps and blocking commitments\u00a0will likely limit all three tight ends to bye week fill-in options and cheap DFS punt plays.\n",

Behind Smith, backup Tyler Conklin has recovered from his hamstring injury and set to play in Week 1. Conklin has a career yards per route run of just 1.0, and is unlikely to deliver a strong fantasy season unless he monopolizes tight end snaps. Conklin's chances of doing that took a big hit when the Vikings traded for Chris Herndon Tuesday. The\u00a0former Jet looked like an emerging star as a rookie in 2018. He was then abysmal in his two seasons under Adam Gase, as is customary. If Herndon can recapture his early career form, the pass-catching tight end could be improbably fantasy relevant this season.\n",

Arnold will have a plus Week 4 matchup in the Cowboys as Christian McCaffrey (hamstring) likely sits, creating a targets vacuum. He will be an option to make the salaries fit in DFS.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Carroll said the addition of Everett to Seattle's offense gives the team \"the fanciest, sweetest-looking receiver/tight end mix that we\u2019ve had.\" \"He\u2019s like a wide receiver, he\u2019s got terrific after-the-catch run ability, really aggressive and he\u2019s a good blocker, too, and he knows the system inside and out,\" Carroll said of Everett, who followed new Seahawks offensive coordinator Shane Waldron from the Rams. Everett largely split snaps with Tyler Higbee last year in LA, catching 41 of 62 targets for 417 yards and a touchdown. There remains a chance he could share the tight end pass-catching role with Will Dissly this season.\u00a0The Athletic's Michael-Shawn Dugar said in March that\u00a0Dissly \"may be in position to hold the top spot\" on the Seahawks' depth chart, even after the Everett signing. Everett's athleticism, after-the-catch ability, and familiarity with Waldron gives him the edge to lead Seattle tight ends in targets and catches. Everett is a solid late-round stacking partner with Russell Wilson in best ball leagues.\u00a0\n",

Graham will still play, especially in the red zone, but he's now the TE2 in what should be a subpar passing offense (especially as long as Andy Dalton remains under center).\n",

Callahan, meanwhile, has a strange fascination with five Bengals pass catchers recording 50 grabs this season. The Athletic's Jay Morrison said Joe Burrow \"established an immediate connection\" with Uzomah in 2020, as the tight end saw five targets in Week 1 and six looks in Week 2 before going down with a season-ending Achilles injury in the first half. Drew Sample started the rest of the season for Cincinnati and ran the 12th most tight end routes on his way to a miserable 4.9 PPR points per game. Uzomah, 28, has been fully cleared and is expected to be a full go for training camp. He should be a popular late-round target in the Bengals' pass-heavy offense.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "McPherson, the 149th pick in the 2021 draft, drilled a 50-yarder against Washington in Friday's preseason game -- a kick that would have been good from at least 60 yards. McPherson is the favorite in the team's kicker competition with veteran Austin Seibert, who has also impressed coaches and beat writers this month. The Bengals offense is among the league's most kicker friendly. Last season, Randy Bullock was fantasy's third highest scoring kicker when Joe Burrow went down with a season-ending knee injury. Fantasy managers should consider McPherson if the game's top kickers are off the draft board.\u00a0\n",

There was some buzz in the first week of August that Blankenship's job was in real danger a year after he logged the fifth most field goals in the NFL. The Colts attempted the fourth most field goals in 2020 -- a key factor in Blankenship's fantasy usefulness. There's no reason to reach for Hot Rod in 2021 drafts, though you could do worse than the second-year kicker in the final round of redraft leagues.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Fantasy football's No. 2 kicker in 2020 is cashing in on a profoundly efficient season in which he made 36 of 39 field goal attempts, banging through all 36 of his extra point tries. He established himself as one of the league's big-footed kickers by nailing eight of nine kickers over 50 yards. Sanders' extension includes a $10 million guarantee. His 2020 numbers stand in stark contrast to his 2019 stats, which include seven missed field goals on 30 attempts. Only the Cowboys and Falcons attempted more field goals than Miami in 2020, giving Sanders the opportunity necessary to become a waiver wire darling in fantasy. Sanders will probably be one of the most over-drafted kickers in fantasy football next season.\u00a0\n",

The Bears were simply overjoyed by Santos' competent 2020 after years in the kicker wilderness. Santos converted 93.8 percent of his 2020 field goal tries, boosting his career mark to 83.1. Santos is not called on very often from 50-plus yards, making him an extra unlikely recipient of this kind of contract. There's a chance this deal could quickly become an albatross.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Jacksonville special teams coordinator Nick Sorensen confirmed the red-hot kicker competition during minicamp. Lambo's lingering hip injury limited him to four games in 2020 and left the team scrambling for viable kicker options. Jacksonville's cast of kickers hit 18 of their 25 field goal attempts (72 percent), the third lowest rate in the NFL. They were the third worst in extra point conversions too. The most accurate kicker in Jags history, Lambo will have to outplay Rosas this summer if he's to keep his gig in 2021. Rosas -- the seventh highest scoring kicker in 2018 as a member of the Giants -- made eight of 11 attempts last year for Jacksonville. Whoever wins the team's kicker job will have some streaming appeal this season.\n",

Collins was brought in under former head coach Matt Patricia, partially based on their time together in New England. With Patricia long gone and the winless Lions already looking toward the 2022 season, a deal to move the veteran linebacker makes sense. Collins started 14 games in Detroit last year and defended six passes, intercepting one and adding a sack along the way. Contending teams looking for a seasoned veteran should be calling the Lions throughout the week.\n",
