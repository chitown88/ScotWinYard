He added 39 rushing yards on five carries.Wilson was incredible once again, keeping his club one step ahead of the Patriots' comeback attempts. The dual-threat quarterback completed touchdown passes to five different receivers in this one, bringing his season total up to nine through two contests. Wilson could be involved in yet another shootout next week against a Dallas squad that can put up points but has trouble preventing them.",

He also lost a fumble on the Cowboys' second offensive possession of the game.As if the three rushing scores did not already boost him toward a week-winning fantasy performance Sunday, Prescott's 450 passing yards were good for the third-most in his 66 career regular-season outings. Prescott's performance surely was enhanced by game script, as Dallas fell into a 29-10 halftime deficit, forcing the quarterback to put up 28 pass attempts in the third and fourth quarters in order to execute a comeback. With 716 passing yards already to his name in 2020, Prescott will next face a Seahawks defense that gave up 450 passing yards in its season debut.",

    "headlineNews": "Jaguars' Gardner Minshew: Numbers go for naught in loss",
    "report": "Minshew completed 30 of 42 passes for 275 yards with no touchdowns and one interception in the Jaguars' 31-13 loss to the Dolphins on Thursday. He also rushed three times for 22 yards and lost a fumble.Minshew had one of the better stat lines you'll see for a quarterback on the wrong end of an 18-point decision. The second-year gunslinger once again displayed above-average accuracy while averaging 6.5 yards per attempt, but he found himself frequently under duress while taking four sacks and 10 hits overall. Minshew's first turnover, a third-quarter fumble at his own seven, was particularly costly and came on one of those sacks, while the second occurred late in the contest with Jacksonville trying to tack on a meaningless touchdown. Despite Thursday's so-so fantasy effort, Minshew does still sport solid numbers in that regard through his first three games, as he owns a 6:2 TD:INT and has quickly amassed 787 passing yards. He and his teammates will look to regroup ahead of a favorable Week 4 road matchup against the Bengals on Sunday. Oct. 4.",

With Green Bay dominating on the ground, Rodgers' numbers took a step back after he threw for 364 yards and four touchdowns in the season opener. The veteran quarterback's week-to-week contributions will vary due to Green Bay's reliance on the ground game, but he's at the helm of an offense that's averaging 42.5 points per game. Up next is a Week 3 trip to New Orleans for a heavyweight battle on Sunday Night Football, and Rodgers could be without top receiver Davante Adams, who exited early with a hamstring injury.",

Regardless, he's thrown for multiple touchdowns in each game to start the season, and he has excellent matchups against Atlanta, Indianapolis and Carolina over the next four weeks, which may allow him to function as a top-24 quarterback during that time.",

He also rushed five times for 17 yards.Watson's completion percentage was fine, but he missed some crucial throws in the Texans' second loss in two games. The most critical miss came on a fourth-and-one at their own 34 that gave Baltimore a short field for their first touchdown. The Ravens came prepared to shut down running back David Johnson, who gained just 34 yards on 11 carries, so it was up to Watson and the passing offense. He wasn't helped when Ravens linebacker L.J. Fort turned a Keke Coutee fumble into a touchdown. On a positive note, Watson connected with newcomers Brandin Cooks (five catches, 95 yards) and Randall Cobb (five, 59) after the pair were quiet in Week 1. Watson will try to avoid an 0-3 start in Week 3's road match against the 2-0 Steelers.",

He made use of all his weapons as rookie Chase Claypool caught an 84-yard touchdown pass and second-year wideout Diontae Johnson added a 28-yard score of his own. The veteran took some time to get into the season opener against the Giants, but he's now posted a 5:1 TD:INT and has piled up 540 yassing yards on 73 attempts through two weeks. Roethlisberger will look to continue his bounceback campaign next Sunday in a favorable matchup against the Texans.",

The result was a big fantasy effort for the QB, who fell just short of scoring a game-winning rushing TD on the final play of the contest. As long as he can avoid the sort of injuries that his style of play can sometimes lead to, Newton's dual-threat ability gives him weekly fantasy upside if he continues to click with his wideouts, as he did versus Seattle. He'll take aim at the 1-0 Raiders at home this coming Sunday.",

Murray appears to be taking a huge step forward in his development this season, and he could be poised for another big game in Week 3 against a Lions defense that couldn't contain either Aaron Rodgers or Mitchell Trubisky in its first two contests.",

    "headlineNews": "Bengals' Joe Burrow: Strong numbers in loss",
    "report": "Burrow completed 37 of 61 passes for 316 yards with three touchdowns and no interceptions in the Bengals' 35-30 loss to the Browns on Thursday. He also rushed seven times for 19 yards and had two fumbles, losing one.The rookie finished with a strong line despite much of his success coming in the shorter areas of the field, as evidenced by his 5.2 yards per attempt. Burrow did appear to take another step forward in his development through sheer volume of reps if nothing else, and he connected with three different pass catchers in C.J. Uzomah (Achilles), Mike Thomas and Tyler Boyd for his trio of scoring tosses. Burrow's last two scoring drives impressively covered extended stretches of the field, as he led the Bengals on marches of 83 yards on 14 plays and 75 yards over 16 plays in the fourth quarter. The 2020 first overall pick will now get some extra time to rest his arm, work on ball security and build further rapport with his pass-catching corps ahead of a tough Week 3 road test against the Eagles on Sunday, Sept. 27.",

    "report": "Mayfield completed 16 of 23 passes for 219 yards with two touchdowns and one interception in the Browns' 35-30 win over the Bengals on Thursday. He also rushed three times for six yards.After a fairly dismal season-opening performance in a thorny matchup against the Ravens, Mayfield was set up nicely for a bounce-back effort in Week 2, considering the significant step down in competition. The oft-maligned quarterback mostly maximized his favorable circumstances, helping the Browns jump out to a 14-3 lead via a 43-yard touchdown connection with Odell Beckham. Mayfield subsequently capped off another second-quarter scoring drive with a six-yard toss to Kareem Hunt, and although he did throw an early fourth-quarter interception, it came on a deep downfield pass into Bengals territory. The numbers Thursday weren't markedly different for Mayfield than his 189-yard, one-touchdown, one-interception performance against Baltimore, but the fact he went 7-for-9 when targeting his top duo of Beckham and Jarvis Landry offers reason for optimism. Mayfield will look to keep his momentum going in a Week 3 home date against the Washington Football Team on Sunday, Sept. 27.",

He also ran for 16 yards on four carries during the game.From a statistical perspective, the four-time Pro Bowler is playing out of this world to kick off his 13th NFL campaign, with a 67.8 percent completion rate, 723 passing yards, and a 6:1 TD:INT through Week 2. Atlanta's secondary continues to get torched on the opposite side of the ball, making it very feasible that Ryan finishes top six among quarterbacks in pass attempts for a fifth straight season. Last year the Falcons led the entire NFL in passes, and so far this year Ryan has launched an astronomical 90 attempts. Next up is a showdown against a Bears defense that just handed the Giants' Daniel Jones his first career start without a touchdown pass.",

    "headlineNews": "Buccaneers' Tom Brady: Solid but unspectacular Week 2",
    "report": "Brady completed 23 of 35 passes for 217 yards with one touchdown and one interception in the Buccaneers' 31-17 win over the Panthers on Sunday. He also netted zero yards on his one rush and lost a fumble.Following a season-opening loss to the Saints in which he threw two interceptions, including a pick-six, Brady checked into Sunday's second straight divisional matchup looking to right the ship. Despite being hampered by the absence of Chris Godwin (concussion), the future Hall of Famer was able to put together a solid effort that nevertheless saw him commit two turnovers once again. However, as opposed to his miscues against New Orleans, the mistakes didn't come at critical moments for the Buccaneers. Brady also commemorated his second touchdown pass to Mike Evans in style, hitting his top wideout for a nifty 23-yard score in the latter portion of the first quarter to up Tampa Bay's lead to 13-0 pending Ryan Succop's extra point, and he saw running back LeSean McCoy drop a perfectly placed pass in the end zone that would have given him a second scoring toss. Brady clearly still has some more kinks to work out while adapting to coach Bruce Arians' scheme, and having Godwin potentially back at his  disposal in a Week 3 interconference road battle against the Broncos would help in that regard.",

He also rushed seven times for 38 yards and another score and logged one reception for no gain.In the team's Week 2 loss to the Bills, Fitzpatrick went a long way toward resembling the quarterback who knows coordinator Chan Gailey's offense well from having run it with ample success in both Buffalo and New York. Thursday, game script didn't call for Fitzpatrick to be anywhere near as active through the air, but the efficiency he demonstrated was that of a quarterback completely comfortable within a system. The veteran connected on his first 12 passes, a career best, and finished with a 133.3 rating for the night, misfiring only twice while averaging 8.0 yards per attempt and notching completions to seven different pass catchers. With the air attack now seemingly considerably ahead of where it was just two weeks ago in the opener against the Patriots, Fitzpatrick and his teammates will utilize some much-needed extra time to gear up for a formidable Week 4 interconference challenge in the form of the visiting Seahawks on Sunday, Oct. 4.",

The Saints' passing game clearly missed top wideout Michael Thomas, often resulting in Brees dumping passes down to tailback Alvin Kamara. Although Tre'Quan Smith did rather admirably with some crossing routes and Brees hit Jared Cook for a six-yard touchdown, his accuracy waned on longer attempts downfield. The 41-year-old also threw an uncharacteristically poor interception right to a defender prior to halftime. While Brees did rack up some yards while facing soft coverage late, he'll still be eager for a much improved performance in Week 3 versus the Packers whether Thomas suits up or not.",

    "report": "Bridgewater completed 33 of 42 passes for 367 yards with no touchdowns and two interceptions in the Panthers' 31-17 loss to the Buccaneers on Sunday. He also lost a fumble.A game script that saw the Panthers down by 21-0 by halftime worked in favor of Bridgewater's fantasy managers, as it required the veteran quarterback to constantly put the ball up in the second half. Bridgewater unsurprisingly made a couple of errors with that level of volume, and considering he was under constant duress while getting sacked five times. Despite the high number of completions, however, Bridgewater only completed passes to three wideouts overall -- D.J. Moore, Robby Anderson and Curtis Samuel -- with all but two of of his other connections transpiring with running backs Mike Davis and Christian McCaffrey. Through two games, Bridgewater has rewarded managers with a whopping 637 passing yards, but that's been accompanied by a pedestrian one touchdown versus two interceptions. Bridgewater will look to helm a more balanced offense in a Week 3 road interconference battle against the Chargers.",

He turned it up a notch in the second half and helped his team draw level with a 54-yard touchdown pass to Tyreek Hill in the fourth quarter. Mahomes then led a methodical 13-play drive in overtime to set up the winning field goal, completing crucial passes to Hill and Clyde Edwards-Helaire to set it up. The superstar signal-caller now has five touchdowns and 513 yards with no interceptions through two games and will look to continue his excellent start next Monday night in a tough matchup with the Ravens.",

He threw a short touchdown pass to Zach Pascal to add a slight boost to his fantasy production, but he still finished with lackluster numbers overall and now has a 2:3 TD:INT through two games. Rivers will enjoy a favorable matchup next Sunday against the Jets and will look to jumpstart his season after mixed results in the early going.",

The 32-year-old signal-caller was capable of putting up decent production against Green Bay last week with his team trailing throughout the second half, as he wrapped up with 259 passing yards and two touchdowns. Minnesota had only four offensive possessions throughout the entirety of the second half Sunday against Indianapolis, with the first three opportunities going interception, punt, punt on a combined 11 plays. Cousins will look to get back on track Week 3 with the Vikings taking on a Titans defense that gave up 339 passing yards and three touchdowns to Jacksonville's Gardner Minshew on Sunday.",

The journeyman signal-caller performed well in relief of Lock against Pittsburgh's vaunted defense Sunday, when he completed 18 of 34 pass attempts for 256 yards, two touchdowns and one interception, but he'll have to manage without top wideout Courtland Sutton (knee) going forward.",

    "report": "Haskins completed 19 of 33 passes for 223 yards and a touchdown while rushing for eight yards on one carry in Sunday's 30-15 loss to the Cardinals.Washington was down by 14 points by the end of the first quarter and 20-0 at the half, but Haskins wasn't able to engineer a comeback win for the second straight week. The second-year QB continues to show great chemistry with Terry McLaurin, but none of his other targets were able to make a significant impact.  Haskins may need to get other players involved on the road in Week 3 if he's going to keep pace with a Browns offense that just erupted for 35 points against the Bengals.",

Per Popper, Lynn said that the Chargers haven't considered placing Taylor on injured reserve, the team won't take any chances with the veteran signal-caller Week 3, given that he's understandably not 100 percent. Taylor will presumably be officially ruled out by the end of the week, while Herbert will have an opportunity to build off his strong NFL debut versus an 0-2 Carolina squad that will be missing star running back Christian McCaffrey (ankle).",

Through two games, Goff has totaled just 58 pass attempts after leading the NFL with 626 attempts in 2019. Instead, the Rams have opted for a more run-heavy approach, putting the ball in Goff's hands less. He's still got some streaming appeal in favorable matchups, but he's not a weekly must-start option due to the lack of volume and focus on the ground game.",

    "report": "Jones completed 25 of 40 passes for 241 yards, no touchdowns and an interception in Sunday's 17-13 loss to the Bears. He also gained 21 yards on three carries.Jones was strip-sacked on the opening drive, went three-and-out on the following drive and threw a pick on the Giants' third possession. New York entered the locker room scoreless at halftime, with Jones posting just 73 passing yards. He started to get rolling toward the end of the third quarter and nearly salvaged the otherwise ugly showing with a last-second TD drive, but Golden Tate was called for offensive pass interference in the end zone, marking the end of the game. It was an unfortunate outing after the second-year QB showed some promise in Week 1 against the Steelers. However, the bigger storyline may be RB Saquon Barkley potentially tearing his ACL in the first half Sunday. If that's the case, Jones will carry a heavy burden in Week 3 against the 49ers.",

He added 12 rushing yards on four carries.So much for Tannehill's regression to the mean, as the 2019 Comeback Player of the Year continues to tear up the league, posting another multi-TD passing performance in Week 2. With Sunday's outing, Tannehill now has multiple passing scores in nine consecutive regular-season outings, with three or more passing TDs in three of those appearances. Tannehill's efficiency during that span is remarkable -- he has averaged only 26.2 pass attempts per game since Week 10 of last season. If Tannehill has been a stalwart of your fantasy lineup so far, Week 3 would not be the time to pull him as he goes up against a Vikings defense that has surrendered 578 passing yards and five passing touchdowns through its first two appearances of the year.",

    "report": "Darnold completed 21 of 32 passes for 179 yards and a touchdown in Sunday's 31-13 loss to the 49ers. He also rushed twice for seven yards.Darnold focused on getting the ball out of his hand quickly to slow down San Francisco's pass rush. He was sacked only once, but Darnold failed to orchestrate much offense outside of a 30-yard touchdown to Braxton Berrios in garbage time. Breshad Perriman (ankle) and Chris Hogan (ribs) both left the game, leaving New York without its top four wide receivers with Jamison Crowder (hamstring) and Denzel Mims (hamstring) inactive. Given his lack of weapons, Darnold will be fighting an uphill battle in Week 3 against a Colts team that's coming off a convincing win over the Vikings.",

The signal-caller built up a streak of completions and was particularly sharp on third downs, with his first two touchdowns coming then. Carr upped the ante for his third score, tossing a one-yarder on fourth-and-goal to start the second half and give Las Vegas the lead. That TD went to tight end Darren Waller, who easily paced the team in all receiving categories, but to his credit, Carr connected with 11 different pass-catchers Monday. Such distribution should have Carr feeling confident ahead of Week 3's trip to New England.",

    "headlineNews": "Saints' Alvin Kamara: Two touchdowns in defeat",
    "report": "Kamara rushed 13 times for 79 yards and two touchdowns in Monday night's 34-24 loss to the Raiders. He also caught all nine of his targets for 95 yards.Kamara was dynamic in the absence of top wideout Michael Thomas, as he led the Saints in all major receiving categories while benefitting from the team trailing most of the second half. The tailback also dazzled on the ground, improving greatly on his mere 16 rushing yards Week 1. Just like in the season opener, however, Kamara again scored twice, with Monday's scores both coming from inside of five yards. As one of the league's most dangerous playmakers, Kamara should remain a big threat whether or not Thomas is available Week 3 versus the Packers, but he sports extra upside in the passing game if his teammate is sidelined again.",

The back's receiving skills had been a work in progress when he entered the league, but Elliott has now averaged 4.2 catches per game dating back to the start of 2018 (compared to 2.3 receptions per game between 2016 and 2017). Fresh off a comeback win, Elliott and the Cowboys' rushing attack now prepare for a Week 3 matchup against a Seahawks defense that contained Atlanta to 72 team rushing yards in its season debut.",

    "report": "Gurley registered 61 rushing yards on 21 carries, and he was not targeted during Sunday's 40-39 loss to the Cowboys.Immediate indications of Gurley's overall workload are encouraging, but the lack of passing game usage is slightly troubling in the early going of his Falcons career. That element was crucial to him becoming an All-Pro and fantasy rockstar between 2017 and 2018. Gurley did see his receiving involvement decrease substantially last year as he garnered only 49 targets in his final season as a Ram, but at his peak the two years prior, Gurley accounted for better than 60 catches per year with an average of 684 receiving yards and five receiving touchdowns. Through two games in Atlanta, Gurley has just two catches for one yard, while backup Brian Hill has tallied four catches for 19 yards. Gurley does have 35 carries through his first two outings, but given that he's running behind a line that allowed the sixth-most stuffs in 2019, rushing opportunities may not be an uber-efficient route to fantasy production.",

    "report": "Ekeler carried the ball 16 times for 93 yards and caught all four of his targets for 55 yards in Sunday's 23-20 overtime loss to Kansas City.While it was an impressive performance for Ekeler, it could have been bigger -- quarterback Justin Herbert ran in a four-yard TD while Joshua Kelley also topped the century mark in scrimmage yards on 25 touches. The Chargers' backfield increasingly looks like a 1A/1B arrangement rather than Ekeler being entrusted with lead duties, but that could still lead to big numbers for both backs in Week 3 against a Panthers run defense that's already been lit up by Josh Jacobs and Leonard Fournette this season.",

Given his productivity in the face of adversity this week, Conner figures to dominate the touches again next Sunday against the Texans. Injuries remain a concern, however, so fantasy managers will hope he doesn't feel any lingering effects heading into the contest.",

He's been quite effective as a receiver, too, catching an end-zone target from Russell Wilson in the fourth quarter that went down as the winning score. Carlos Hyde and Travis Homer will continue to get some work in the backfield, but Carson is the unequivocal No. 1 RB and should be utilized in fantasy as such. Carson will have a tough test Week 3, however, as the Cowboys just held the Falcons' Todd Gurley to 2.9 yards per carry.",

In addition, he out-targeted backfield mate Tarik Cohen for the second week in a row, and it would appear that he's a player the coaching staff is preparing to lean on throughout the season. However, it should be noted that he's been productive against a pair of weak run defenses, though his current role in the offense provides optimism that he can be trusted as a top-24 running back option each week.",

Not only did the undrafted rookie free agent account for both of the Jaguars' scores, he also checked in tops on the team in receptions and receiving yardage. While game script prevented the Illinois State product from seeing the 16-carry workload he enjoyed in the first two games, he's now upped his reception total over that of the previous contest in two straight contests. Given his robust usage and the Bengals' questionable run defense, Robinson's fantasy prospects are favorable for a Week 4 road battle against Cincinnati on Sunday, Oct. 4.",

    "report": "With Zack Moss (toe) out this week, Singletary should see added carries Sunday against the Rams.Through the Bills' first two games, Singletary logged 19 rushing attempts for 86 yards while adding seven catches on 10 targets for 43 yards. In that span, Moss carried 17 times for 48 yards and caught three of his four targets for 16 yards and a TD. With Moss unavailable this weekend, Singletary should see the bulk of Buffalo's backfield work versus Los Angeles, with T.J. Yeldon a candidate to be active for the first time this season and see some change-of-pace action. Though the Rams are 2-0, they've allowed 257 rushing yards to date, resulting in solid fantasy results for Ezekiel Elliott in Week 1 and Miles Sanders in Week 2.",

    "report": "Cook collected 63 yards and a rushing touchdown on 14 carries, while also corralling both of his targets for eight receiving yards during Sunday's 28-11 loss to Indianapolis.Cook had averaged 17.5 carries per game over his past 15 regular-season outings entering Week 2, but the Vikings were less able to lean on the team's Pro Bowl back down the stretch, having fallen into a 15-point deficit by the 9:27 mark of the third quarter. The Colts' lead would only balloon from there, leaving Cook with a workload of 16 or fewer offensive touches for the third consecutive game. Despite just 119 scrimmage yards to his name thus far this season, Cook's fantasy value has been largely salvaged by his three touchdowns -- each of which has come via a goal-line rush attempt. The star back may get it going in the yardage department in Week 3, when the Vikings take on a Titans defense that surrendered 165 team rush yards to Jacksonville on Sunday.",

    "report": "Jones rushed seven times for 23 yards and a touchdown and brought in both of his targets for four yards in the Buccaneers' 31-17 win over the Panthers on Sunday.Jones was teed up for a potentially fruitful fantasy day against the Panthers' porous run defense, and accordingly, he opened the scoring with a seven-yard touchdown run with 5:42 remaining in the first quarter. However, the third-year back then saw coach Bruce Arians afford Jones' backfield mate Leonard Fournette plenty of work, leading to the latter posting a 12-103-2 line on the afternoon. Despite Arians' preseason proclamation that Jones was the clear lead back, there was still a certain degree of uncertainty until the games began, and as Week 2 demonstrated, Arians could opt to go with a hot-hand philosophy in his backfield the majority of weeks. Jones will look to make up for a relatively pedestrian Week 2 effort in a tough Week 3 road matchup against the Broncos next Sunday.",

    "report": "Henry ran for 84 yards on 25 rush attempts during Sunday's 33-30 win against the Jaguars. He was also targeted twice in the passing game but recorded zero receptions.The Jacksonville defense stepped up against the NFL's leading rusher from 2019, containing Henry to a meager 3.4 yards per rush after he accumulated an absurd 7.0 yards per carry in his four preceding outings against the Jaguars. Combining Sunday's results with Henry's Week 1 performance (3.7 YPC), the 2019 Pro Bowler is off to an inefficient start to 2020, though he is still benefitting from a gargantuan workload. The 26-year-old has already garnered 59 offensive touches through Tennessee's first two outings, as the Titans now prepare for a Week 3 matchup against  the 0-2 Vikings.",

He managed to bring in a 16-yard touchdown pass from Jeff Driskel in the fourth quarter en route to the best performance of his young Broncos career. Gordon's uptick in offensive output was in part due to the absence of Phillip Lindsay (toe), and he showed he can still produce  when given 20-plus touches per game. He should play a similar role in next Sunday's matchup against the Buccaneers.",

With rookie J.K. Dobbins coming off a big debut last week and Lamar Jackson also getting heavy usage on the ground, Ingram's production could remain erratic all year, but if he gets a healthy workload he could deliver a strong return in Week 3 against a Kansas City defense that just gave up over 100 scrimmage yards to both Austin Ekeler and Joshua Kelley in an overtime victory.",

    "report": "Taylor carried 26 times for 101 yards and a touchdown Sunday against the Vikings. He also caught both his targets for nine additional yards in the 28-11 win.Taylor stepped in for the injured Marlon Mack (Achilles) and churned out 110 scrimmage yards against a respectable defense, though his average of 3.9 yards per carry was a bit lackluster. He scored his first career rushing touchdown on a five-yard carry in the second quarter and helped his team control the game after jumping out to a big lead in the second half. Taylor should see a similar workload next Sunday against the Jets and should be considered an ascending fantasy option heading into a contest Indianapolis is expected to win.",

    "report": "Kelley carried the ball a team-high 23 times for 64 yards and caught two of three targets for 49 yards in Sunday's 23-20 overtime loss to Kansas City.It's noteworthy that Kelley saw a bigger workload than Austin Ekeler in a close game, with the rookie getting 25 touches to the more senior back's 20 -- although Ekeler was more productive with 148 scrimmage yards. The Chargers' backfield increasingly looks like a 1A/1B arrangement rather than Kelley being confined to backup duties, but that could still lead to big numbers for both backs in Week 3 against a Panthers run defense that's already been lit up by Josh Jacobs and Leonard Fournette this season.",

Instead, he saw just four touches, including a four-yard loss on his only reception of the game. His fumble in the fourth quarter made the game interesting but the Steelers held on to go 2-0 for the first time since 2016. With Conner healthy, Snell will likely take a backseat in Week 3 against the Texans.",

    "report": "Fournette rushed 12 times for 103 yards and two touchdowns and brought in four of five targets for 13 yards in the Buccaneers' 31-17 win over the Panthers on Sunday.The Buccaneers entered the matchup against their divisional opponent likely knowing the ground game was poised for success, but given previous statements by coach Bruce Arians, that scenario appeared to set up best for Fournette's backfield mate Ronald Jones. While the latter did find the end zone once, Fournette had the better and splashier performance by far. The former Jaguar first pushed in a one-yard score late in the third quarter to extend Tampa Bay's lead to three touchdowns, then he put an exclamation point on his afternoon with a key 46-yard scamper with 1:48 remaining that snuffed out any hope of a Panthers comeback after they'd narrowed the deficit to seven. Fournette displayed excellent downhill speed on the run, and given the caliber of his numbers, he may have made an irrefutable case for a greater share of the rushing workload moving forward. Fournette will look to build on Sunday's body of work in a tough Week 3 road tilt against the Broncos next Sunday.",

He was much more involved as a pass catcher, however, and demonstrated the ability that made him such a tantalizing fantasy prospect leading up to the season. Despite a rather meager per-touch output in Week 2, the rookie still has 208 scrimmage yards and a touchdown through his first two NFL contests. Edwards-Helaire could find the sledding tough next Monday night against Baltimore, but his multi-faceted skillset should allow him to generate ample fantasy utility.",

    "report": "Chubb rushed 22 times for 124 yards and two touchdowns and brought in his only target for nine yards in the Browns' 35-30 win over the Bengals on Thursday.Chubb and backfield mate Kareem Hunt put on a clinic against the porous Bengals front seven, with the two combining for an average of 6.6 yards per rush on 32 carries. For his part, Chubb saw a nice bump in workload from a Game 1 tally of 10 carries, comfortably outpacing Hunt in that department by 12 rushing touches overall after having trailed his teammate by three against Baltimore four days earlier. The third-year pro's 11-yard trip to the end zone in the first quarter opened the scoring on the night for Cleveland, and Chubb later added a one-yard touchdown in the latter stages of the third quarter to extend the Browns' lead to double digits. The fact the Week 2 rushing workload tilted much heavier in Chubb's direction had to elicit a sigh of relief from fantasy mangers for the time being, and the Georgia product will look to put together a successful encore at the expense of the Washington Football Team in a Week 3 home tilt on Sunday, Sept. 27.",

    "report": "Brown and Darrell Henderson figure to share backfield work with Cam Akers (ribs) ruled out for Sunday's game in Buffalo, Jourdan Rodrigue of The Athletic reports.The rookie started the first two games of the season, but Brown ended up getting more work in the opener, and Akers then suffered a rib cartilage injury in the first quarter of the Week 2 contest. Brown also came out of the game with an injury, undergoing surgery Monday on a fractured left pinky finger. He'll be available for Sunday's contest and figures to have a role, but it is possible the finger issue impacts his workload, particularly in the passing game. Brown will be splitting snaps with Darrell Henderson, who piled up 121 yards from scrimmage on 14 touches last week.",

Coleman likely will be out for about a month, while Mostert appears week-to-week. McKinnon and Jeff Wilson are left as the healthy running backs on the active roster, though undrafted rookie JaMycal Hasty could be called up from the practice squad at any moment. While his injury history might create some concerns about workload management, McKinnon at least figures to take a decent chunk of the carries and the majority of the passing-down work. He's done well with his limited opportunities so far this season, producing 121 yards and two TDs on only nine touches.",

The defense was clearly focused on not allowing the fourth-year back to have his way yet again, shutting Mixon down for 2.9 yards per rush and a long gain of just nine yards. The Oklahoma product was encouragingly more involved in the passing game than during the team's Week 1 loss to the Chargers, and he's likely to continue building rapport with rookie quarterback Joe Burrow in that regard as the season unfolds. Mixon will now turn his attention to a Week 3 road matchup against the Eagles' elite run defense on Sunday, Sept. 27.",

    "report": "ESPN's Mike Reiss suggests that if Michel \"wants to keep his job as the Patriots' No. 1 running back, it isn't a stretch to say he needs a big game\" Sunday against the Raiders.After a seven-carry, 19-yard effort in Week 2's loss to the Seahawks, Michel will look to rebound Sunday, but he could have some added competition for carries as soon as next weekend, with Damien Harris (hand) eligible to come off IR following Week 3 action. This Sunday, however, Michel will have a chance to head the Patriots' backfield, with Rex Burkhead likely to handle complementary/change-of-pace work with James White (personal) out, while J.J Taylor is on hand in a reserve capacity.",

Smith garnered all five of his touches between quarters one and three, but when the game tightened up in the final frame, Todd Gurley received 100 percent of the running back workload. The Falcons will try to right the ship Week 3 against the Bears, as they face off against a Chicago defense that ranks among the league's stingiest units with just 163 rushing yards allowed so far to opposing RBs.",

    "headlineNews": "Browns' Kareem Hunt: Scores twice in Week 2 win",
    "report": "Hunt rushed 10 times for 86 yards and a touchdown and brought in both his targets for 15 yards and another score in the Browns' 35-30 win over the Bengals on Thursday.For the second time in four days, Hunt was particularly efficient on the ground, and he averaged 8.4 yards per play on the 12 occasions he got his hands on the ball overall Thursday. While the 2017 third-round pick did play a clear second fiddle to backfield mate Nick Chubb in terms of rushing workload after outpacing him by three carries in Week 1, Hunt still offered plenty from a fantasy perspective with six-yard receiving score in the second quarter and a game-sealing one-yard scoring run in the fourth quarter. It's likely Chubb remains the clear lead back on most weeks, but as Hunt has demonstrated on several occasions since stepping into game action for the Browns midway through last season, he's capable of making very good use of his opportunities. He'll look to put together another strong performance against the Washington Football Team in a Week 3 home battle on Sunday, Sept. 27.",

    "report": "Gaskin rushed 22 times for 66 yards and brought in all five targets for 29 yards in the Dolphins' 31-13 win over the Jaguars on Thursday.Through the Dolphins' first two games, the backfield wealth was essentially spread amongst Gaskin, Matt Breida and Jordan Howard, with no clear-cut lead back. That clearly changed for at least one game Thursday, as Gaskin outpaced his aforementioned teammates by 19 carries each and also co-led the team in both receptions and targets. The second-year back wasn't anywhere near as efficient on the ground as during the first two games of the season, when he averaged 5.4 yards on his 16 rushes. However, the boost in volume on the ground was certainly a welcome sight for Gaskin's fantasy managers, who now have reason to hope the Washington product could be headed for a true workhorse role moving forward that also includes a solid pass-catching component. Gaskin will look to make good on that potential in a Week 4 home date against the Seahawks on Sunday, Oct. 4.",

Freeman inked a $3 million deal Tuesday and could eventually lead the backfield in touches, although the Giants may utilize a committee approach at first to ease him in.",

Meanwhile, starting running back Kenyan Drake has racked up 108 offensive snaps and scooped up most of the backfield work (40 total touches). Edmonds will make the occasional splash play, like he did in the season opener, but as long as Drake is healthy, the former will have outings like Sunday's more often than not.",

    "headlineNews": "Steelers' Jaylen Samuels: Non-factor in win",
    "report": "Samuels ran once for two yards and caught his lone target for one yard in Monday night's 26-16 win over the Giants.Samuels had just three touches all game, despite an early injury to James Conner (ankle), and his only carry came in the final seven minutes. As expected, Benny Snell is first up if Conner cannot go, and he may grab extra carries even if Conner is healthy. In either scenario Samuels seems to have little fantasy value.",

    "report": "Dobbins had two carries for 48 yards Sunday against the Texans. He added one 13-yard reception on one target.Dobbins' usage was surprisingly low Sunday after his impressive two-touchdown debut Week 1. He played 20 snaps, which was the same amount as Gus Edwards, but Edwards had 10 carries for a team-high 73 yards. The Ravens have deployed a fairly even backfield rotation thus far with Mark Ingram leading the way with 48 percent of the snap share while Dobbins has played 43 percent of the snaps and Edwards checks in at 35 percent. Dobbins did not see his first carry until midway through the third quarter. The rookie has plenty of talent, but consistent volume could be hard to come by with the Ravens using such a deep running back rotation, not to mention Lamar Jackson's contributions to the run game as well.",

The playing time clearly is there for Thompson as he's played 31 and 30 offensive snaps the past two weeks, but his 65 scrimmage yards on 12 touches better illustrates his involvement in the offense. The 29-year-old is seeing plenty of snaps in the passing-down role, but to this point Robinson is the only back on the team providing much production.",

The rookie started the past two weeks, and Malcolm Brown leads the team with 29 carries, but Henderson could be the top guy for Week 3 at Buffalo. While Brown isn't listed on the final injury report, he's dealing with a broken left pinky finger that could impact his ability to catch passes. With that in mind, Henderson could benefit from increased receiving work even if he's still sharing carries.",

    "report": "Hill collected 14 rushing yards on three carries while also hauling in both of his targets for 11 receiving yards during Sunday's 40-39 loss to Dallas.The 24-year-old back has garnered five offensive touches in each of Atlanta's first two outings of the year, a workload similar to his 2019 average of 6.5 touches per game. Todd Gurley soaked up 72.4 percent of Falcons running back carries against the Cowboys, while Ito Smith earned five carries of his own, limiting Hill to a bit role in the offensive operation. He will continue to be a complementary piece in the Atlanta backfield, but Gurley remains the unquestioned No. 1 heading into a Week 3 matchup against the Bears' 11th-ranked rush defense.",

However, any hope of Hyde splitting reps with Carson has essentially been extinguished, as Carson will be the unequivocal lead back as long as he stays healthy. Hyde is a solid insurance policy in deeper formats, but Travis Homer could get some reps as well if Carson gets hurt.",

    "report": "Hines had one reception for four yards and no carries in Sunday's win over Minnesota.Hines played just nine snaps while Jonathan Taylor played 49 snaps and Jordan Wilkins played 17 snaps (rushing for 40 yards). Hines' usage is a bit confounding, but it's likely just a byproduct of a game that became a rout in the second half, and the Colts decided to use Wilkins to run out the clock. Sunday's game more likely highlights how Taylor is set to get the bulk of work with Hines in a more limited backup role than many expected. Hines should still have a larger workload in games where the team needs to make more throws to running backs.",

    "headlineNews": "Panthers' Mike Davis: Looks like Week 3 starter",
    "report": "Davis appears set to start Sunday's game against the Chargers after the Panthers placed Christian McCaffrey (ankle) on injured reserve Wednesday, ESPN.com reports.Davis only had one carry against the Buccaneers in Week 2, but he made some explosive plays in the passing game, catching all eight of his targets for 74 yards. The veteran journeyman won't play 95-plus percent of snaps that McCaffrey typically has, so Trenton Cannon, Curtis Samuel and Reggie Bonnafon could also see increased carries versus Los Angeles. Still, Davis looks like the clear favorite to lead Carolina's backfield, and how well he fares against the Chargers' formidable defensive front could play a role in determining whether he keeps the starting gig for the entire duration of McCaffrey's expected 4-to-6-week IR stint.",

Dobbins scored twice in the Ravens' opener, it looked like Edwards had been relegated to the bottom of the depth chart, but only Lamar Jackson carried the ball more often Sunday than he did. There was plenty of yards to go around for the entire Baltimore backfield -- the team amassed 230 rushing yards in total -- but it could be tough to predict from week to week which RB will see the biggest share. Edwards could still be productive on limited touches in Week 3 against a Kansas City defense that just gave up over 100 scrimmage yards to both Austin Ekeler and Joshua Kelley in an overtime victory.",

    "headlineNews": "Vikings' Alexander Mattison: Hardly contributes on stat sheet",
    "report": "Mattison registered three carries for 13 yards while also contributing one catch for three receiving yards during Sunday's 28-11 loss to the Colts.There seemed to be a fantasy-relevant role available for Mattison based on Week 1, as he collected 80 scrimmage yards on 10 touches while fielding 37 percent of the offensive snaps against the Packers. Week 2 was certainly disappointing in comparison; Mattison totaled only four offensive touches to Dalvin Cook's 16. The fact that Minnesota fell into a significant hole on the scoreboard mitigated Mattison's involvement, but if the Vikings can keep the score close or even take a lead Week 3 against Tennessee, the second-year back is more likely to get involved.",

Besides that, Alvin Kamara found himself in the midst of a magical night, racking up 79 yards and two touchdowns on the ground as well as 95 receiving yards on a combined 22 offensive touches. Murray wasn't able to put forth a noteworthy performance against his former team, but now he'll focus on a Packers defense that has surrendered 4.9 yards per rush to opposing running backs through two weeks.",

Booker looked explosive on a few plays, racking up a 15-yard run and 14-yard reception. He isn't likely to carry much standalone value, though Booker appears to be the back to roster in case of a Jacobs injury.",

    "report": "Cooper snagged six of nine targets for 100 receiving yards during Sunday's 40-39 win against the Falcons.The four-time Pro Bowler was held to limited practice participation Thursday while nursing a bruised foot, but that certainly wasn't evident on the field Sunday as Cooper carved up the Falcons' porous secondary. Atlanta's defense was left depleted without cornerback Kendall Sheffield (foot) in the lineup, and Cooper was able to capitalize with his first 100-yard showing since Week 10 of last season. The 2015 No. 4 overall draft choice was shaky during the fantasy playoffs last December in posting sub-25-yard receiving outings in Weeks 15 and 17, but so far this season Cooper is off to a solid start with 80-plus receiving yards in each of his first two appearances. He and the Cowboys' prolific passing attack now travel to Seattle in Week 3 to take on a Seahawks pass defense that surrendered 450 passing yards to Atlanta in its season debut.",

    "report": "Thielen caught three of eight targets for 31 receiving yards during Sunday's 28-11 loss to Indianapolis.It's not that Minnesota wasn't trying to feed the ball to the team's top perimeter weapon, as Thielen garnered twice as many targets as the No. 2 option, Irv Smith, during Sunday's defeat. In a similar game script Week 1, Thielen carved up Green Bay during junk time, registering two fourth-quarter scores as the Vikings tried to play catch up. With Minnesota again trailing by double digits in the second half Sunday, Kirk Cousins looked Thielen's way on five occasions. The two were unable to connect for a single completion in the third and fourth quarters, though Thielen did draw an illegal contact penalty as well as a pass interference call. If there is any consolation to invested fantasy GMs, it may be the fact that Thielen next draws a matchup against a Titans defense that surrendered 339 passing yards and three passing touchdowns to Jacksonville during Week 2.",

In fact, the Steelers approach the weekend with no players listed with Week 3 injury designations. Smith-Schuster thus is poised to handle his usual pass-catching duties Sunday opposite fellow starter Diontae Johnson. The duo combined for 15 catches on 21 targets in Week 2's win over the Broncos, with Smith-Schuster logging a 7-48-0 stat line off his eight targets. Another busy day figures to be in store for both players versus a Houston squad that's off to an 0-2 start following losses to AFC powerhouses Kansas City and Baltimore.",

Beckham bounced back in Thursday's win over the Bengals (four receptions for 74 yards and a touchdown), and at this point, the Browns remain committed to seeing if the wideout can continue to build chemistry with 2018 No. 1 overall pick Baker Mayfield. Including the current season, Beckham has four years at annual average salary of $15 million remaining on the contract extension he signed with the Giants in 2018 before being dealt to the Browns last offseason.",

Overall he finished second on the team in targets and scored for the second straight week while vastly improving his yardage output.

    "headlineNews": "Bengals' A.J. Green: Getting resettled after lost 2019",
    "report": "Green said Thursday that he's started to feel more comfortable on the field after missing the entire 2019 season with an ankle injury and being limited by a hamstring injury in training camp, Ben Baby of ESPN.com reports. \"I'd be lying if I didn't say I didn't think about [the ankle] the first game,\" Green said. \"For me, it's just going out there and having full confidence in myself that I'm not going to get hurt again. Each week, I get better and better and more comfortable.\"Though Green declared himself 100 percent healthy prior to the season, the seven-time Pro Bowler hasn't looked like his old self through the Bengals' first two games. He's hauled in only eight of 22 targets thus far, with his 36.4 percent catch rate well off his 59.6 percent mark from his first eight years in the NFL. Despite the poor results, Green is optimistic that his chemistry with quarterback Joe Burrow and his comfort in coach Zac Taylor's offensive system will improve as the season rolls along, which should lead to better production. Until that materializes, however, Green shouldn't necessarily be treated as the must-start fantasy option he's been for most of his career.",

Ramsey himself has even implied as such throughout the week. It'd be hard to advise sitting Diggs, currently toed as the league's leading receiver, but just know things might not come as easy to him as the first two weeks, when he matched up against more friendly defenses.",

It was a tough battle, but Metcalf can declare a victory, as he hauled in a 54-yard TD pass in tight coverage in the first half and showed off his expanded route tree to snag three more over the course of the game. This is Metcalf's second straight game with more than 90 receiving yards and a score, and if Gilmore struggled to cover him, there will be few matchups that slow him down this year. Metcalf is a surefire fantasy start Week 3 when the Cowboys come to town after they allowed 273 passing yards and four scores to Matt Ryan and the Falcons on Sunday.",

    "report": "Moore secured eight of 13 targets for 120 yards in the Panthers' 31-17 loss to the Buccaneers on Sunday.A week after an underwhelming season-opening effort that saw him post a 4-54-0 line, Moore once again saw plenty of attention heaped on him by new quarterback Teddy Bridgewater. To the delight of fantasy managers, the results were markedly different, with Moore posting game-high totals in receiving yardage and targets while tying for second in receptions. Through two contests, Moore has now logged a robust 22 targets, an encouraging sign for the trust and chemistry he's manufactured with Bridgewater. Moore will look to build on Sunday's strong effort in a Week 3 interconference road battle versus the Chargers.",

He's up to his usual efficiency, too, as Lockett has now reeled in 15 of 16 targets for 159 yards and a score this year. Metcalf has been targeted on the deeper passes -- an area in which Lockett also excels -- but the tandem is a clear 1A-1B where both should be considered viable fantasy starters on a weekly basis. The Seahawks have a favorable Week 3 matchup in store, as Dallas allowed Matt Ryan to throw for 273 yards and four scores Sunday.",

Even with the lower volume, Brown led the team in targets, receptions and yards Sunday. Brown has played 81 percent of the team's snaps, a significant uptick from the 60.4 percent he played as a rookie while working his way back from foot surgery. Not only is Brown playing a higher volume of snaps, he's also dominating the Baltimore passing game. He's seeing 113.0 air yards per game and has accounted for 47.3 percent of the Ravens' air yards. His aDOT is 18.8 yards, which is nearly the highest in the league. Brown and the Ravens will face the Chiefs in Week 3.",

It's early, but the team's QB turmoil hasn't disrupted Allen's volume, and he could be poised for a productive Week 3 against a Panthers defense that just allowed Mike Evans to pile up 104 receiving yards and a TD.",

The 27-year-old has been able to carry over his 2019 rapport with quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick into this season despite the limited practice time in a new offense, as he's now brought in 14 of 17 targets for 169 yards and a touchdown through three games. Parker will now have a chance to get his legs some extra rest ahead of a Week 4 home matchup against the Seahawks on Sunday, Oct. 4.",

    "report": "Slayton hauled in three of five targets for 33 yards in Sunday's 17-13 loss to the Bears.Slayton was outstanding in Week 1 with a 6-101-2 line, but he registered a floor game in Week 2, as the Giants struggled to generate much offense. The 2019 fifth-round pick is a boom-or-bust player by nature of his deep targets, but it is a bit concerning that he only received two targets before the Giants' final drive. He'll look for a correction next week when the 49ers come to town.",

Rampant touchdown production is nothing new for Ridley, as with two touchdowns Week 1 against the Seahawks, he tied Julio Jones for the most receiving TDs (19) through a player's first 30 games as a Falcon. Atlanta has put up an astronomical 90 pass attempts through its first two outings of the year, indicating that Ridley may continue to provide immense value so long as he can stay healthy. The slate becomes more difficult in Week 3, however, as the Falcons host a Bears defense that has allowed just one receiver to go over 65 yards thus far this season.",

Although he was busy, a number of erratic passes from Mitch Trubisky led to multiple missed connections and a poor fantasy performance. However, with upcoming matchups against the Falcons and Colts, expect Robinson to return to the levels of performance that fantasy managers expected when selecting him on draft day.",

    "report": "Lamb hauled in six of nine targets for 106 receiving yards during Sunday's 40-39 win against the Falcons.The first-round rookie wideout had an encouraging yet modest NFL debut last week, registering 59 receiving yards on five catches. However, Week 2 marked his breakout. Lamb and Amari Cooper torched the depleted Falcons secondary, combining for a dozen catches and more than 200 yards on the afternoon. Lamb contributed an enormous play in the waning stages of Sunday's contest, tearing off a 24-yard gain on Dallas' final drive to set up Greg Zuerlein with a 46-yard field goal for the walkoff win. The 21-year-old wideout carries momentum heading into a Week 3 matchup against a Seahawks defense that allowed three different wideouts to go for nine catches and 110-plus receiving yards in its season opener.",

The sixth-year wideout recorded a game-high 50-yard grab, and he also connected with Brady for a 23-yard touchdown catch in the latter portion of the first quarter for Tampa Bay's second touchdown of the day. Evans paced the pass-catching corps in receptions, receiving yardage and targets, unsurprising given Chris Godwin's (concussion) absence. Evans will look to thrive in a Week 3 road battle against the Broncos that should present a tougher matchup for the Bucs' passing game.",

    "headlineNews": "Cowboys' Michael Gallup: Held to two catches Sunday",
    "report": "Gallup caught two of five targets for 58 yards in Sunday's comeback win over the Falcons.He was fifth in targets on the day for the Cowboys, as Amari Cooper, CeeDee Lamb, Ezekiel Elliott and even tight end Dalton Schultz all saw more looks from Dak Prescott. Gallup did make his receptions count, however, hauling in a 20-yard pass late in the first half to set up a field goal and then making a leaping 38-yard grab along the sideline late in the fourth quarter that eventually led to Prescott's third rushing TD of the game. One of Dallas' trio of wide receivers is likely going to be on the back burner in any given week, but it won't necessarily be Gallup every time. He'll look to get more involved Week 3 against a Seahawks secondary that just gave up 397 passing yards to Cam Newton.",

In fairness, the Colts controlled the game from the second quarter on and threw just 25 times total on the day. Still, it was a bit disappointing from a fantasy perspective to see his workload diminish despite the absences of Parris Campbell (knee) and Jack Doyle (knee/ankle), and he's totaled just 81 yards through two games in the Rivers era. Hilton will enjoy a favorable matchup next Sunday against the Jets and will look to take advantage, especially if his teammates remain out of the lineup.",

    "headlineNews": "Dolphins' Preston Williams: Catches first TD of season",
    "report": "Williams brought in both his targets for seven yards and a touchdown in the Dolphins' 31-13 win over the Jaguars on Thursday.Williams was able to salvage what would have been a complete wash-out of a night for fantasy managers with his three-yard touchdown grab in the first quarter. The Colorado State product has struggled to make an impact in new coordinator Chan Gailey's offense thus far, posting just five catches on 14 targets through three games. The solid amount of looks is encouraging, and Williams may be able to start converting them into better production the more he familiarizes himself with the scheme. He'll look to push his numbers up across the board in a Week 4 home matchup against the Seahawks on Sunday, Oct. 4.",

However, Boyd atoned for the error with time winding down, notching a nine-yard scoring grab  with 48 seconds remaining that brought the Bengals to within 35-30 and gave them a brief glimmer of hope. Boyd led the Cincinnati pass-catching corps in receptions and receiving yards Thursday, and for what it's worth, displayed a lot more efficiency with Burrow than top wideout A.J. Green, who could only bring in three of the 13 passes thrown his way. Boyd has 13 targets through the first two games despite Green's return to action, and he'll look to build on Thursday's effort in a Week 3 road matchup against the Eagles on Sunday, Sept. 27.",

However, the touchdown saved his fantasy day, and the 28-year-old receiver should return to being more involved in the passing attack in Week 3. While Woods is definitely a tier or two behind the top fantasy wide receivers, his production floor is high, and he's also proven to be one of the more reliable weekly contributors during his tenure with the Rams.",

    "report": "Landry said he's getting closer to being 100 percent following offseason hip surgery, Mary Kay Cabot of the Cleveland Plain Dealer reports.Landry acknowledge he's not fully back from the surgery he underwent in February. At the time, he was given a 6-to-8 month recovery timeline, and he's still a few weeks away from the eight-month mark. \"I'm still working through things,'' he said. \"I'm giving it my best, giving it my all when I am out there. Obviously, whatever my 100 percent is on Sunday, that's what I'm giving.\" Landry has had a modest start to the season with eight catches (nine targets) and 107 receiving yards through the first two weeks. If the Browns continue to run like they did in last week's win over the Bengals -- they ran 60 percent of the time and attempted just 23 passes -- targets will be capped for Landry and fellow wideout Odell Beckham.",

With the second-year QB looking more polished as a passer this season, the entire Arizona passing game should be more productive, but Fitzgerald's role and inability to stretch the field at 37 years old will still limit his fantasy utility to deeper PPR formats.",

    "headlineNews": "Jaguars' Keelan Cole: Posts 67 total yards in loss",
    "report": "Cole brought in four of five targets for 43 yards and returned one kickoff for 24 yards in the Jaguars' 31-13 loss to the Dolphins on Thursday.With DJ Chark (chest) sidelined for Thursday's game, Cole was third in receptions and second in receiving yardage on the night. The 27-year-old has gotten plenty of attention from quarterback Gardner Minshew through the first three games of the season, as he's now logged 17 targets, 15 of which he's brought in for 148 yards and two touchdowns. Cole saw his role diminish last season while playing with Minshew and Nick Foles -- he slumped to a career-low 24 receptions for 361 yards over 16 games -- but his outlook appears much brighter through the first three games of 2020. Cole will look to keep up the momentum, with or without Chark available, when the Jaguars face the Bengals in a Week 4 road matchup in Sunday, Oct. 4.",

The speedster did fumble early in the third quarter after a seven-yard catch, but Carolina got the ball right back on a Donte Jackson interception a play later. Anderson now has an elite 83.3 percent catch rate on his first 18 targets of the campaign, giving him no shortage of fantasy value and momentum heading into a Week 3 road interconference matchup against the Chargers.",

Tight end Darren Waller completely dominated the pass-catching workload in attracting 16 targets on the night, while not another Raider finished above three. Even with Derek Carr having thrown to a 73.5 percent completion rate and a 4:0 TD:INT, Renfrow has so far been a low-volume option in the passing game. If a breakout performance were to come for Renfrow in Week 3 against New England, it may come via red-zone usage, as he finished second on the team in red-zone looks last year with 10.",

The 49ers were hurt by a slew of lower-body injuries sustained during Week 2, so this offense may look completely different while down two key running backs and, most likely, its starting quarterback. This could lead to more passing volume for Bourne and San Francisco's other top receiving options even with backup Nick Mullens under center, as Mullens proved to be a capable signal caller back in 2018.",

Watkins was a critical piece in the Chiefs' passing attack last year against the Ravens, piling together five receptions on eight targets for 64 yards, although that production came during the absence of Tyreek Hill, who faces no such limitations in the 2020 version of this high-profile contest.",

And with the amount of plays we've been running, touches are hard to come by.\"Kubiak is alluding to Minnesota's depressed volume, with the team running an NFL-low 96 plays through two weeks (no other team has fewer than 115). That number will regress to the mean -- at least to some extent -- but it's also true that nobody has stepped up as a viable No. 2 receiving option behind Adam Thielen. Olabisi Johnson is second on the team with seven targets, catching four passes for 80 yards. Jefferson also has been efficient with his limited opportunities (five of six for 70 yards), but his snap share sunk from 69 percent in Week 1 to 54 percent in Week 2, while Johnson went in the other direction (from 63 percent up to 79 percent). In any case, neither makes for a trustworthy fantasy option Week 3 against Tennessee.",

The Titans characteristically ran the ball 34 times Sunday, while five different players posted at least two catches on Ryan Tannehill's 18 completions. Davis is off to an encouraging start to the campaign with 10 catches and 137 receiving yards through his first two outings, and Week 3 presents an enticing matchup as he goes up against a Vikings defense that has already allowed four different pass catchers to go for 60-plus receiving yards this season.",

    "report": "Fuller wasn't listed on Wednesday's injury report.Fuller spent time with the training staff during Sunday's 33-16 loss to Baltimore, ultimately finishing the game without any targets on 63 percent snap share. He caught eight passes while playing 80 percent of snaps against the Chiefs in Week 1, so it's hard to imagine the reduced role Week 2 wasn't at least partially related to an injury. Whatever the case, Fuller is healthy enough to avoid the Week 3 injury report as the Texans prepare for another tricky matchup, this time traveling to Pittsburgh.",

    "headlineNews": "Panthers' Curtis Samuel: More involvement on tap",
    "report": "Panthers offensive coordinator Joe Brady said Thursday that he wants to get Samuel more involved in Carolina's future game plans, Steve Reed of the Associated Press reports. \"Good things happen when the ball is in his hands,\" Brady said of Samuel.Samuel has taken on offensive snap shares north of 70 percent in both of Carolina's first two games of the season, logging 10 targets and five rushing attempts between the two contests. While Samuel may continue taking a back seat to D.J. Moore and Robby Anderson in the passing game, he could be a candidate to take on more work as a runner as the Panthers look to replace star back Christian McCaffrey (ankle), who is expected to miss the next 4-to-6 weeks. Mike Davis is in line to start at running back Week 3 against the Chargers, but he likely won't be asked to take on as much volume as McCaffrey has handled as a runner and pass catcher over the past couple of seasons. With that in mind, Samuel could emerge as a de facto change-of-pace option behind Davis, as the 24-year-old has proven adept as a ballcarrier in limited opportunities thus far during his career. Over his three-plus seasons in the NFL, Samuel has carried 36 times for 309 yards (8.6 average) and three touchdowns.",

He was fortunate on his touchdown reception, as Mitchell Trubisky threw the ball across the field, and Mooney was able to secure the football just before the defender could make a play. Mooney has been targeted three times while posting over 35 yards in each contest to start the season, and he's frequently seeing single coverage playing across the field from Allen Robinson, which will give him a chance to post regular production.  At this point, he's a player that fantasy managers should consider adding to rosters as a depth piece in the hopes he can boost his target volume in the upcoming weeks.",

Before being sidelined with an ankle injury Weeks 14 through 17, Humphries averaged a shade over three catches and 31 receiving yards per game during 2019. Humphries already has 11 receptions and 95 combined receiving yards on the young season, and he's one score away from tying his touchdown total from all of last year. The 27-year-old wideout is set up well going into Week 3, facing a matchup against a Vikings defense that has surrendered 578 passing yards through its first two outings of 2020.",

    "report": "Edwards (foot) doesn't carry an injury designation for Sunday's game against the Patriots.The No. 81 overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft logged limited practices this week, but he'll be able to give it a go Sunday and is thus slated to maintain his starting role in the team's offense. The Raiders will be without first-rounder Henry Ruggs (knee/hamstring) this week, meaning Zay Jones and Nelson Agholor are candidates for added snaps behind Edwards and Hunter Renfrow. Edwards caught both of his targets for 42 yards in this past Monday's win over the Saints, and with an increase in volume a plausible outcome as the season rolls along, the 6-foot-3, 212-pounder has a chance to surface as a fantasy option in deeper formats.",

    "report": "Snead caught both of his targets for 29 yards Sunday against the Texans.The veteran slot receiver continues to be effective when targeted, having caught all six of his targets for 93 yards and a touchdown through two games. Snead has a catch of at least 20 yards in each game as well. While Snead is effective in his role, it's not a role that adds up to much volume. He ranks fourth on the team in target share, and Baltimore has attempted a league-low 50 passes as a team. Snead and the Ravens will take on the Chiefs in Week 3.",

    "report": "Williams recorded two receptions on four targets for 14 yards in a 23-20 overtime loss to the Chiefs on Sunday.It was a lackluster outing for Williams, particularly after re-asserting his deep-game prowess in the Week 1 win over the Bengals. That's in large part thanks to a game script that emphasized getting 2020 No. 6 overall pick Justin Herbert comfortable in his first career start, with Keenan Allen (seven catches for 96 yards) and Hunter Henry (six for 83 yards) racking up most of the team's passing yardage. It's still a bit troubling Williams only received four targets in a game where the Chargers attempted 33 passes, especially considering Herbert's deep ball should in theory aid Williams much more than that of nominal starter Tyrod Taylor.",

    "headlineNews": "Saints' Emmanuel Sanders: Involvement should increase",
    "report": "Coach Sean Payton said Wednesday that Sanders' \"touches are going to come\" in future games, John Hendrix of SI.com reports.Sanders only has four catches for 33 yards and a score (eight targets) through two contests. Despite Michael Thomas (ankle) having missed Monday's loss to the Raiders, Sanders took a clear back seat to Tre'Quan Smith and finished the night with just one 18-yard grab. The veteran could simply need more time to adjust to the new offensive scheme, and Payton does appear adamant about increasing Sanders' involvement as the season progresses. That said, Sanders will be difficult for fantasy managers to trust in the immediate future, making him far from a must-start option Week 3 against the Packers, even if Thomas sits out again.",

It was a good sign that quarterback Deshaun Watson has developed some chemistry with his new targets, but that usage could be contingent upon Fuller's health.",

However, outside of a solid, chain-moving catch on third-and-10, Amendola didn't make nearly as big of an impact as he did in the season opener, though Matthew Stafford did blow a chance to hit a wide-open Amendola down the right sideline at one point. It seems Golladay has a chance to return Week 3 against the Cardinals, which may be a net positive for Amendola even if it costs him a downturn in targets.",

    "report": "Johnson had one reception for 24 yards on three targets in Sunday's loss at Indianapolis.Johnson played 42 snaps on offense compared to Justin Jefferson's 29 snaps, but Jefferson had three receptions on a similar three targets. Minnesota's passing game couldn't get on track as Kirk Cousins struggled with a 15.9 NFL passer rating, so it's hard to read too much into Johnson's performance. Johnson still is ahead of Jefferson on the depth chart, but it seems only a matter of time before the 2020 first-round draft pick passes him for a more prominent role.",

The veteran tight end didn't receive another target for the rest of the game. It was a costly mistake, but Olsen still logged 71 percent of the offensive snaps -- higher than Week 1's 66 percent. He'll continue to be the No. 1 TE in Seattle moving forward, but his fantasy value may be touchdown-dependent.",

The second of those plays was a 20-yard TD catch from backup QB Jeff Driskel, and Fant immediately followed it up with a catch on the two-point conversion to get Denver within three points of Pittsburgh. After a disappointing conclusion to 2019 in which he only picked up four or more receptions once over his final six appearances, Fant is red hot to kick off 2020. He now draws a matchup against a Buccaneers defense that hasn't allowed a tight end touchdown since Week 11 of last season (tied for the longest active streak in the NFL).",

Gronk's legendary rapport with future Hall of Fame quarterback Tom Brady has yet to materialize; in fact, the tight end was the intended target Sunday on Brady's lone interception. Gronkowski's fantasy dud was made all the more galling by the fact receiver Chris Godwin (concussion) was sidelined for the contest, which could have seemingly set up the former for a significant boost in opportunity. Gronkowski will look to put his forgettable 2020 start behind him when the Buccaneers clash with the Broncos in a Week 3 interconference road battle.",

The Penn State product may see his reception volume fluctuate depending on game flow, but based on his strong second-half finish in 2019 and early returns this season, it's clear Gesicki's fantasy prospects are on the right trajectory. He'll look to play a bigger role in a Week 4 home matchup against the Seahawks on Sunday, Oct. 4.",

James O'Shaughnessy officially received the start but played only 27 offensive snaps, though he caught three of four targets for 29 yards. Eifert remains the Jaguars' top tight end, but his six catches for 55 yards and one touchdown through three games illustrates the difficulty in utilizing him as a fantasy option.",

    "report": "Cook caught two of five targets for 13 yards and a touchdown in Monday night's 34-24 loss to the Raiders.Cook extended New Orleans' first-half lead with a six-yard touchdown on third down during the second quarter. While the tight end used his body well to make that grab, Cook didn't haul in another pass until the Saints' final drive of the game. At that point, the team's struggles without Michael Thomas in the passing game were pronounced, with Tre'Quan Smith the only one to really capitalize on his absence outside of the always-involved Alvin Kamara. On the bright side, Cook has now reached 80 yards or scored a touchdown in both games thus far, offering encouragement ahead of Week 3's matchup against the Packers.",

While neither did much in this contest, it seems the Eagles have two legit tight-end options heading into a Week 3 matchup with Cincinnati, and Goedert merits consideration as a low-end TE1 with that target share.",

    "report": "Izzo was on the field for 70 of the Patriots' 72 snaps on offense in Sunday's 35-30 loss to the Seahawks, Mike Reiss of ESPN.com reports.In the process, Izzo hauled in both of his targets for 19 yards.  Meanwhile, for the second straight week, Devin Asiasi recorded 10 snaps and zero targets, and fellow rookie Dalton Keene (neck) was inactive. Izzo remains the Patriots' most trusted tight end while the younger players at the position are worked in gradually, but he's not seeing enough volume in the team's passing game to merit fantasy attention in anything but the deepest of formats.",

The tight end will be desperate to make a larger impact in Week 3 versus the Chargers, but Sunday's goose egg sets the bar incredibly low.",

Sunday against Dallas, he was heavily involved in the game plan from the jump, as Matt Ryan took a deep shot to Hurst on his second pass attempt of the game before connecting with the tight end on a 42-yard completion two drives later. By the end of the contest, Hurst had finished one yard shy of his career high in receiving (73 yards) from 28 games with the Ravens. Week 3 presents a matchup against a Bears defense that's already surrendered 13 catches, 120 receiving yards and one touchdown to opposing tight ends on the year.",

The fourth-year TE ended up leading the team in receptions, targets and receiving yards. This increase in usage came after Sterling Shepard (toe) and Saquon Barkley (knee) left the game. Barkley may be done for the year with a torn ACL, but Shepard's injury doesn't appear to be as serious. When Shepard returns, the two could battle for targets.",

    "report": "Akins had a career-high seven catches on seven targets for 55 yards in Sunday's 33-16 loss to the Ravens.Akins has been a surprise through the first two weeks. After scoring a touchdown Week 1, he finished second in targets behind Brandin Cooks in Week 2. He's caught all nine of his targets through two weeks while doubling the playing time of Darren Fells, who entered training camp as the presumptive No. 1 tight end and scored Houston's lone touchdown Sunday. That usage may be a function of the Texans playing from behind a lot, but Akins is emerging as a go-to option for quarterback Deshaun Watson.",

    "report": "Hockenson caught four of four targets for 62 yards during Sunday's 42-21 loss to the Packers.The absences of Kenny Golladay (hamstring) and Halapoulivaati Vaitai (foot) seem to have thrown a wrench in the Lions' offensive plans. While Hockenson has secured all nine of the passes sent his way through two weeks, he's only seen one target in the red zone, and his overall upside is likely capped as long as the Lions offense continues to struggle. If Golladay, in particular, remains out Week 3, expectations for Hockenson should remain capped despite a seemingly inviting matchup with the Cardinals. Even though the Arizona defense was notoriously poor at defending tight ends in 2019, the retooled unit has only allowed 11 receptions for 84 yards and no scores through two weeks.",

    "report": "Schultz corralled nine of 10 targets for 88 yards and a touchdown, losing one fumble during Sunday's 40-39 win against the Falcons.Fantasy GMs in leagues large and small will be rushing to the waiver wire to add the 24-year-old tight end, as he may have secured a key role within Dallas' high-octane passing attack as result of Blake Jarwin's torn ACL. Schultz attracted just 19 combined targets across his first 27 NFL appearances between 2018 and 2019, but he has already garnered 14 in the early going of the new campaign. The slate toughens up somewhat in Week 3, as the Cowboys take on a Seahawks defense that permitted just three catches and 38 receiving yards to the tight end position in its season opener.",

    "report": "Hooper caught two of four targets for 22 yards in Thursday's 35-30 win over the Bengals in Week 2.The Browns threw only 23 times, so targets were limited across the board, but Hooper had two more Thursday than he did in Week 1's loss to the Ravens. The Browns were able to run their offense, designed to lean heavily on the ground game and use tight ends. He was on the field nearly as much as quarterback Baker Mayfield, playing 57 of 58 snaps. Hooper hasn't found the end zone after two games but was targeted once in the red zone Thursday.",

    "report": "Howard secured one of three targets for 11 yards in the Buccaneers' 31-17 win over the Panthers on Sunday.With Chris Godwin (concussion) sidelined Sunday, there was cautious optimism among some of the other Bucs skill-position players' fantasy managers that there would be a positive residual effect for several members of the offense. That never really materialized for any one player, including Howard, who actually saw his targets halved from his Week 1 tally. The fourth-year tight end will look to get back on track in Week 3 against the Broncos on the road, irrespective of whether Godwin is available for that contest.",

The 24-year-old tight end should play a larger role in Week 3 against the Colts given the lack of healthy pass catchers left in the Jets offense.",

He lacks much of a track record and still is an iffy long-term option in fantasy leagues, but he does appear to be the best bet among Packers tight ends after two weeks, and he could be asked to contribute more in the passing game Week 3 if receiver Davante Adams (hamstring) -- and to a lesser degree, fellow tight end Josiah Deguara (shin) and running back Tyler Ervin (concussion) -- cannot take the field.",

    "report": "Smith caught two of three targets for a net loss of one yard during Sunday's 17-13 loss to the Bears.After corralling both of his targets in the season opener for a total of 17 receiving yards, Smith served as little more than a bail-out option for his sophomore signal-caller Daniel Jones. At his peak, Smith racked up 267 yards and three touchdowns between Weeks 12 and 17 last year, but with Evan Engram now back in the fold after missing the latter half of 2019 due to a foot injury, the 23-year-old Smith has attracted a mere five targets in two games. Smith and the Giants will see a 49ers defense in Week 3 that is without the services of Nick Bosa (knee), Richard Sherman (calf), and Solomon Thomas (knee), though as a whole San Francisco has conceded the second-fewest tight end receptions in the NFL to this point.",

He had the team's longest gain of the day -- a beautiful 33-yard reception -- and tied for the team lead in targtes. Alie-Cox's performance should earn him a role in the offense once Doyle is healthy enough to return, but with many other mouths to feed in the Colts offense, he shouldn't command an abundance of targets every week. His next outing will come Sunday against the Jets.",

He then got open in the end zone just minutes into the second quarter before capping off his day with a 28-yard scamper down the left sideline where he went in untouched for the hat trick before waving and bowing to the empty stadium. After a huge finish to the 2019 season, it seems Higbee has carried momentum into 2020, settling in as a top-three option in the Rams' passing game.",
