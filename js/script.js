    "headlineNews": "Dolphins' Ryan Fitzpatrick: Retains starting gig",
    "report": "Fitzpatrick will start Week 9 against the Jets, Joe Schad of The Palm Beach Post reports.Fitzpatrick struggled to move the offense after the first quarter of Monday's loss to the Steelers, but he'll nonetheless hold onto the reigns for at least one more contest. Over his last two starts, Fitzpatrick has compiled a meager 3:3 TD:INT ratio, and he's also accounted for four fumbles. The veteran is set for a favorable matchup against the Jets' porous defense Sunday, so he could be worth fantasy consideration in leagues that start multiple quarterbacks. In any case, it wouldn't be a surprise if the winless Dolphins look back to second-year signal-caller Josh Rosen at a later point in the season.",

    "report": "Coach Adam Gase blames himself for Bell getting only 12 touches in Sunday's 29-15 loss to the Jaguars, Rich Cimini of ESPN.com reports. \"We have to make sure [Bell] has touches,\" Gase said. \"Last week was bad. That was on me.\"Overall team strength tends to be a major factor for running back workloads, though less so for prolific pass catchers like Bell, who  averaged 6.3 and 5.7 receptions per game his final two seasons in Pittsburgh. He's down to 4.6 through seven appearances this year, but with just 5.8 yards per catch as well as career-low marks for carries per game (15.6), rushing yards per game (49.9) and yards per carry (3.2). Bell does rank second among all RBs with 91 percent snap share, and a Week 9 matchup with the Dolphins should at least provide temporary relief. Miami has given up the fourth-most fantasy points to RBs under standard scoring, yielding 4.9 YPC and 7.7 yards per target to the position, along with nine touchdowns in seven games.",

He's been a limited participant in practice the last two weeks, and could be headed for a similar designation on Wednesday's injury report. Shepard will likely visit an independent neurologist later this week, per Jordan Raanan of ESPN.com, though it remains to be seen whether he'll receive clearance in time for Monday's tilt against the Cowboys.",
