He added an eight-yard touchdown to Mark Andrews in the fourth quarter but got picked off twice after that to dim Baltimore's comeback hopes before connecting for a 50-yard score with Willie Snead in garbage time. While Jackson has made strides as a passer, he's still much more comfortable operating with a run-pass balance, though big deficits open up the possibility of fantasy-friendly garbage-time production. Jackson remains a high-tier fantasy quarterback ahead of a Week 5 trip to Pittsburgh."

Playing a Detroit defense that has frustrated a Pro Bowl's worth of quarterbacks already this season, Mahomes wasn't playing pitch and catch as he typically does and was held without a touchdown for the first time since Week 5 of last season. Sunday showed that Mahomes is mortal; it just so happens that mortal -- for him -- still includes 369 total yards."

Goff has tossed five INTs in his last two games, and he won't get much time to shake them out of his system with the Rams playing in Seattle on Thursday."

In a contrast to last week, Rivers had plenty of time to survey the field. He routinely hit the aforementioned targets underneath, or particularly in Inman's case, on back-shoulder fades, while easily marching down the field. It won't be smooth sailing in Week 5, however, as the Broncos' vaunted secondary travels to Los Angeles."

Rodgers threw to Marquez Valdes-Scantling in tight coverage at the Eagles' one-yard line with 28 seconds remaining, and Nigel Bradham alertly snatched the tipped ball caused by cornerback Craig James to clinch the upset for Philadelphia. Rodgers otherwise thrilled the Lambeau crowd throughout the contest, shining with touchdown passes to Jimmy Graham and Geronimo Allison, as well as with 10 completions for 180 yards to Davante Adams. The perennial Pro Bowler's ill-timed pick was his first of the season, while Rodgers' 46 rushing yards were easily a season-high figure.

The fifth-year gunslinger was nearly flawless for the majority of the contest, but the pick-six he threw to Marcus Peters in the fourth quarter helped keep the game's outcome in the balance for a while longer. That mistake aside, Winston constantly was a step ahead of coordinator Wade Phillips' defense, showing particular chemistry with Chris Godwin, who overcame a hip injury to connect with Winston for 12 completions, 172 yards and two touchdowns. Winston also showed a propensity for answering when the Rams drew closer, hitting Mike Evans on a perfectly executed stop-and-go route for a 67-yard score early in the fourth quarter to extend Tampa's lead to 45-27 at the time. Winston now has thrown for a combined 685 yards and seven touchdown passes over his last two games and will look to extend his stellar stretch of play in a divisional road showdown versus the Saints in Week 5."

However, with the ground attack working to the tune of 159 combined rushing yards from Jordan Howard and Miles Sanders, the Green Bay defense was kept honest enough to enable Wentz to find occasional success when dropping back. The fourth-year quarterback hit two of his banged-up pass catchers, Alshon Jeffery and Dallas Goedert, for second-quarter touchdown passes, and he subsequently connected with Jordan Howard for a 20-yard scoring toss in the third quarter. Wentz now has multiple touchdown passes in three of the first four games of the season, and although Thursday's yardage tally was his lowest of the campaign, the 26-year-old did remain free of interceptions for the third contest of the season as well.

He was also sacked five times and fumbled once, with Tennessee's Jurrell Casey pouncing on the loose ball.",
        "analysis": "With Sunday's performance, Ryan is now averaging a Herculean 331.3 passing yards per game through four weeks of regular-season play, but his six interceptions on the year are already nearly equal to his total of seven from 2018. Moreover, his lost fumble against the Titans gives him six over his past 20 appearances. Tennessee also proved capable of breaking Ryan's long-standing touchdown streak, an 18-game run dating back to Week 2 of last season in which he threw at least one touchdown in every game and averaged 2.4 touchdown passes per contest. The upcoming Week 5 matchup presents a challenge for Ryan and the Falcons' passing attack, going up against a Texans defense that has surrendered just five passing touchdowns in four outings thus far this season."

Daniel quickly got the Bears into the end zone on a pass to Tarik Cohen, but once the Bears were in firm control of the game throughout the second half, Daniel went into full game manager mode, which held his potential production down. When Daniel took over as the Bears' quarterback for a pair of starts in 2018, he averaged over 250 yards along with 1.5 touchdowns, and if he's pressed into action again, he should be a decent option in leagues that start two quarterbacks."

Rivera stressed that Allen needs to do a better job of protecting the football, but the second-year signal-caller should have a decent amount of leash atop the depth chart with Newton likely to miss at least two more weeks and rookie Will Grier representing an unproven alternative under center."

Not only did he twice turn the ball over in the red zone, but he was also constantly under siege from Pittsburgh's pass rush, resulting in a career high amount of sacks taken. Considering Dalton entered Monday averaging over 325 passing yards per game, it's likely he rebounds in Week 5 against the also-winless Cardinals. However, in order to do so, he'll need far improved protection from his linemen up front, and still won't have top wideout A.J. Green (ankle) at his service."

McCoy  missed the early part of the year with a leg injury but was a healthy scratch Sunday, after logging full practice participation throughout the week."

Allen went to the locker room under his own power but couldn't clear the concussion protocol. Barkley would start in Week 5 against the Titans if Allen is unable to clear the protocol by then."

Therefore, it's tough to really gauge how the team will operate their two-headed backfield. The third-year back has been incredibly productive as the leading ballcarrier for the Chargers, posting 220 rushing yards and 270 receiving yards along with six touchdowns through four games. However, head coach Anthony Lynn made it known Gordon would resume his lead-back role as soon as the team deemed him physically ready, which could occur as early as Week 5 against the Broncos."

His Week 5 outlook is extremely encouraging, as he'll be going up against a Bengals defense that last year gave up the second-most receiving yards to opposing running backs and has been torched for 5.2 yards per carry by the position through its first three appearances of 2019."

The Saints defense appeared determined to not let the Cowboys' run game get going, and that strategy paid off in a low-scoring, defensive affair. A positive takeaway for Zeke's fantasy owners would be that the back garnered 100 percent of Dallas' running back carries. The 24-year-old is still the workhorse of the backfield even with backup Tony Pollard (zero touches) blowing up for 100-plus yards last week. Elliott will look to get back on track against a Packers defense that has allowed opposing rushing attacks to rack up a whopping 142.3 yards per game."

Although coach Ron Rivera and coordinator Norv Turner previously mentioned their preseason hope to scale back McCaffrey's snaps while still increasing his touches, the superstar tailback has only grown in both capacities thus far. Furthermore, with the Panthers looking to keep pace while quarterback Cam Newton (foot) remains sidelined, the ultra-productive McCaffrey only figures to continue carrying the offense, arguably making him fantasy's most-coveted commodity."

Kamara's only shortcomings have been in terms of touchdowns (two through four games after tallying 18 through 15 games last year). The versatile back doesn't profile as a short-yardage/goal-line back, but he has shown to have a nose for the end zone and remains on the field in formations closer to the goal line.

Even more discouraging was the fact that Lindsay was targeted just once, especially considering Royce Freeman saw six passes go his direction. While this was the first game in which Lindsay didn't receive double-digit carries, he has averaged just 3.9 yards per rush this season and appears to be reliant on pass volume and touchdowns to maintain fantasy relevance. He'll look to bounce back in Week 5 against the Chargers."

Behind an at-times brutal offensive line, Mixon has done his best to find lanes the past couple weeks, but his overall outlook is hurt by his poor quality of surrounding talent. Still, his weekly volume props up his fantasy stock, and his upcoming matchup against a Cardinals defense that's surrendered the second-most yards league-wide bodes well for him to return to his more explosive ways."

Howard's pair of rushing scores came in his usual red-zone/goal-line role, as he went in from one and two yards out in the second and fourth quarter, respectively. He sandwiched those visits to the end zone around a 20-yard scoring grab early in the third quarter to cap off a 76-yard drive that erased a slim 21-20 deficit. Howard has now seen his carries increase over that of the prior game in each contest, while his receptions, receiving yards and targets Thursday were all season highs. While the Eagles' backfield situation is far from ideal due to the timeshare between Howard and Miles Sanders, the former looks like a viable play in all formats for a Week 5 interconference battle versus the Jets a week from Sunday."

The second-year back's carry total was a career high, and his five-yard rush just before halftime was his first score of the season. The more dynamic Jones appears to be progressively pulling away with the lead-back job, although it will take multiple weeks with the USC product helming the ground attack for fantasy managers to have complete confidence in that arrangement. Jones will look to continue his ascent in a Week 5 divisional showdown against the Saints."

He was stopped at the 1-yard line twice on the Bills' lone touchdown drive before watching quarterback Josh Allen take it in himself on fourth down. Allen later left the game with a concussion, muddying the waters even further for an offense that's already missing rookie running back Devin Singletary (hamstring). Gore should once again handle heavy volume in what projects to be a low-scoring affair against the Titans in Week 5, especially if SIngletary sits again. It's perhaps worth noting Gore is the oldest player in football to rush for 100-plus in a game since 1978."

White's return from a one-week absence clearly cut into Burkhead's Week 4 workload and it's quite possible that his foot issue was part of the equation that led to him going without a carry Sunday. Though we'd expect him to be more involved in the team's attack in Week 5 against Washington, Burkhead's weekly volume is going to be difficult to predict when both Michel and White are also available."

As Sunday showed, Abdullah can help out a passing game that has struggled mightily this season, but, given Cook's abilities as the team's third-leading receiver, it's unlikely that Abdullah would get too much extra work even if the Vikings try to mix it up a little."

Beckham didn't make a catch until the fourth quarter but showed off his athleticism on a trick play, avoiding a pair of would-be tacklers in the backfield before uncorking a deep ball that went right through the hands of Damion Ratley. It's good to see the Browns trying to find other ways to get the ball in Beckham's hands, but second-year quarterback Baker Mayfield has regressed after a strong finish to his rookie season, leading to a relatively quiet start to the year for the star receiver, outside of his 89-yard touchdown against the Jets in Week 2. Expect Beckham to bounce back on Monday Night Football in San Francisco in Week 5, especially if Landry's unable to suit up."

Chris Godwin has clearly ascended to at least the 1-A option at receiver, but as Evans demonstrated Sunday, he's still highly capable of providing big plays in his own right. He'll look to add to the four touchdowns he's accumulated over that last pair of contests when the Buccaneers face off with the Saints in a Week 5 divisional clash."

        "analysis": "Lockett fell victim to the game script in this contest, and it was a letdown following a two-week stretch where Lockett produced 21 receptions for 233 yards and a touchdown. Lockett's 30.6 percent target share during that stretch was going to be tough to sustain, and it fell to 14.2 in this outing while Russell Wilson threw just 28 times with the Seahawks leading most of the game. Thursday night's clash versus the Rams figures to be a high-scoring affair -- they just allowed 55 points to the Buccaneers -- so Lockett's upside has a good chance of returning if the two squads get into a shootout."

He is back to being a fantasy producer after a down 2018 in which he only logged 69 receptions for 734 yards, as he is currently on pace to account for 92 receptions, 1,200 yards and eight touchdowns if his first-quarter regular-season stats were to be extrapolated out to 16 games.

        "report": "Head coach Kyle Shanahan revealed that Pettis has been dealing with a pectoral injury in addition to a previously reported groin injury to begin the season, Matt Maiocco of NBC Sports Bay Area reports.",
        "analysis": "Pettis' groin injury was kept under wraps to begin the season, and this pectoral injury is only now being announced to the public despite it developing during the preseason. This could help explain the second-year wideout's lack of production through three weeks (five receptions on six targets for 27 yards and a touchdown). The good news is that Shanahan stated that Pettis has been regaining both lower- and upper-body strength, and that culminated in the receiver's best stat line against the Steelers in Week 3 (four receptions for 20 yards and a touchdown). The 49ers' upcoming bye week could help the 23-year-old inch even closer to midseason form. While fantasy owners are unlikely to trust Pettis enough to start him following the rough start, it is worth noting that he has been seeing nearly as many offensive snaps over the past two games (68) as rookie Deebo Samuel (70). It appears that the two youngsters are in a starter's timeshare alongside Marquise Goodwin, who leads all San Francisco wide receivers with 90 offensive snaps over that same two-week period."

Starting quarterback Josh Allen got knocked out of the game in the fourth quarter with a concussion, but backup Matt Barkley proved capable of moving the offense effectively with 127 passing yards after coming in. While Buffalo's red-zone efficiency will likely suffer without the threat of Allen running the ball, the team's receivers could actually benefit from having a more accurate quarterback under center should Allen need to sit out against the Titans in Week 5 or beyond, though having Allen back clearly gives the offense more long-term upside."

It appeared as if he was going to have a very quiet performance, but when Chase Daniel saw him in single coverage down the right sideline, they connected on a 37-yard pass play to give him a respectable fantasy day. Should Gabriel be forced to miss more time, Wims may be a fantasy option who can be used in a pinch, especially during bye weeks. But when Gabriel is healthy, Wims likely won't produce enough to be on fantasy rosters."

We will have to see how that all fits in,\" Kitchens said. \"[Callaway] has to prove that he knows what to do, knows how to do it and knows when to do it. Other than that, Antonio has played. He knows how to play the game. I am glad he is back.\"",
        "analysis": "Callaway has been away from the team through the first quarter of the season while serving a four-game suspension. Despite the missed time, Kitchens is confident the wide receiver can be a contributor this week if Landry doesn't clear the concussion protocol. According to Mary Kay Cabot of The Cleveland Plain Dealer, Landry popped by the locker room Tuesday and was overheard telling a teammate that he \"feels good, 100 percent,\" but the wideout will still need to pass all five phases of the NFL's concussion protocol before his availability for the Monday night game is confirmed. If Landry ends up being active Week 5, Callaway would likely hold only a minimal role in the game plan."

Witten is unlikely to go off for big yardage days like he used to in his prime, so he requires a trip to the end zone in order to provide a high-end fantasy stat line.

Everett remains on the fantasy radar in deep formats due to the offense in which he plays, but for the most part, he's only worth consideration as a bye-week fill-in."
