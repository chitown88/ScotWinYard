The final review of Allen's performance still varies\u00a0depending on when someone tuned in. He nearly threw five interceptions through the first three quarters, missing Cole Beasley (11/109/1) and Stefon Diggs (10/93/1) for\u00a0a handful of wide-open opportunities. With just three minutes remaining and the Bills trailing 26-23, though, Allen nixed\u00a0checking down to Zack Moss and instead scrambled around and rifled the go-ahead touchdown to Diggs 21 yards downfield. Buffalo only fell to 7-3 because DeAndre Hopkins and Kyler Murray connected on a miraculous 43-yard Hail Mary over three defenders with one second remaining. Allen still became just the third quarterback in league history with at least 20 passing touchdowns and five rushing\u00a0scores in consecutive seasons. He'll again rank as a top-five quarterback against Los Angeles' crumbling secondary following\u00a0Buffalo's Week 11 bye.\n",

Playing on a short week after turning the ball over seven times across his past two starts, Wilson was more contained as the Seahawks dialed up 31 rush attempts. It was a badly needed reset from the 'Hawks, who surprisingly got after Kyler Murray on defense and just tried to keep the game in front of them on offense. The sub-200 yard passing effort was Wilson's first of the season, though he has now provided multiple scores in 9-of-10 starts, with the lone exception being last week's dismal loss to the Rams. For fantasy managers worried a more restrained Seahawks could become the norm down the stretch, they have a series of excellent matchups, beginning with the Eagles on 11 days rest in Week 12. Wilson will still be a top-three quarterback every week out.\u00a0\n",

He also missed another potential score to Mark Andrews on a gadget red zone rollout. For the TD he did convert, Jackson lofted a beautiful dime-bucket 31-yard pass to Andrews. His INT was a flat-out bad ball to Devin Duvernay. Titans DB Amani Hooker was allowed to become the wideout on the play. Jackson heads into Thursday's all-important divisional showdown with the Steelers with just four total scores over his past three starts. He hasn't reached 250 yards passing since Week 1.\u00a0\n",

The Bolts were less adventurous\u00a0after the break, letting the Jets vaguely \"get back into it.\" Doing whatever he wanted against a bad defense, Allen relentlessly targeted Keenan Allen while taking no shortage of down-field shots, one of which connected for a 54-yard completion to \"Tyron Johnson.\" The runaway OROY favorite has now turned in five three-touchdown performances across his past seven\u00a0starts, and reached at least two scores every game since Week 4. Frankly, Herbert is playing at an MVP level, not just rookie of the year. He will not win that award, but the No. 6 overall pick has established limitless upside for his career. Week 12 figures to be a shootout with the Bills.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "It was a quiet night for Murray coming off his signature day against the Bills, one seemingly made quieter by a first quarter play where he got his throwing shoulder crunched. Murray could be seen wincing as he warmed up on the sideline, and his passes did not quite have their usual zip the rest of the way. Facing surprising pressure/blitzing from the Seahawks, Murray had trouble connecting with DeAndre Hopkins, finding him for a modest 5/51. His scores went to Dan Arnold and Chase Edmonds, with the latter being in the face of an all-out blitz from the three-yard line. The story going forward will be Murray's shoulder. He seems unlikely to miss any time since he played through the issue for three quarters tonight, but Sam Darnold sat under similar circumstances earlier this season. Murray has 10 days to get right for a road trip to New England.\u00a0\n",

One of Cousins'\u00a0two touchdown\u00a0passes to Adam Thielen can be attributed to the latter's\u00a0sticky hands as Thielen made a\u00a0one-handed grab in the back corner of the end zone that rivaled his one-hander from Week 10. Justin Jefferson also ran himself open for a 39-yard score to retake the lead in the final quarter. Week 12 against the Panthers projects as another game for Dalvin Cook to run wild on 30-plus touches, but it additionally sets up well for Cousins to be used as a\u00a0confident streamer to replace for injuries.\n",

    "analysis": "The Cowboys shifted All-Pro RG\u00a0Zack\u00a0Martin to right tackle and\u00a0Joe Looney to center in place of rookie Tyler Biadisz (injured reserve), which ultimately limited the amount of pressure (11.1%) and sacks (1) Dalton had become accustomed to\u00a0prior to injury. With ample time to observe the field, Dalton targeted Ezekiel Elliott from inside the 10-yard line to get the Cowboys on the board first and later CeeDee Lamb (4/34/1) for a circus-like touchdown as the rookie was falling flat onto his back. Dalton also orchestrated an 11-play, 66-yard drive with\u00a010-yard passes to Michael Gallup, Amari Cooper, and Dalton Schultz on Dallas' final possesion\u00a0before finding the latter for the game-winning two-yard touchdown with 1:27 remaining. The Cowboys now enter Week 12 at 3-7 and in a three-way tie for second place in the NFC East. Thursday's showdown against Washington will move the winner into sole possession of second place behind the 3-6-1 Eagles.\n",

Facing the league's No. 1 run defense in this one, coach Sean McVay dialed up an extreme pass-happy game plan, getting the ball out of Goff's hand quick and into the hands of Cooper Kupp and Robert Woods, who combined for 23-275-1 on 28 targets. Goff still tossed a couple boneheaded picks as he does every now and then, but he was killing this defense with quick-hitters. His other two touchdowns went to rookies Van Jefferson and Cam Akers. Goff will be more of a QB2 next week at home against the 49ers.\n",

In fact, Hill only\u00a0had two carries in the first half, both of which were scrambles. Although his performance hit every step on the Richter scale including\u00a0an underthrown 45-yard lawn dart to Emmanuel Sanders, a designed touchdown run on 4th-and-goal,\u00a0a lost fumble following a 24-yard scramble, and one dropped interception, Hill was both exciting and a breath of fresh air for an offense that previously relied on catching the ball from Brees\u00a0at the line of scrimmage and turning upfield for any amount of yards. Hill\u00a0even revived Michael Thomas (9/104), locking on to the All-Pro for a season-high 51.2% target share. Although it's a small sample, Sunday's performance was enough to crown Hill, complete with a rushing floor, as a top-12 QB in every game he starts moving forward.\n",

Wentz has thrown 14 interceptions in ten games, and has the fourth lowest adjusted completion rate in the NFL. Pederson seemed surprised by a reporter's question about benching Wentz, blaming coaching for Wentz's consistent struggles. Benching Wentz for second-round rookie Jalen Hurts would \u201csend the wrong message to the football team that the season\u2019s over,\u201d he said. Still, fantasy managers in superflex leagues should go ahead and roster Hurts just in case Pederson comes to his senses in the season's final six weeks.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Tannehill also rushed for a two-point conversion where the Ravens were paralyzed in fear of a Derrick Henry attempt. Although it wasn't perfect, it was a slump-busting performance from Tannehill, who had not completed more than 20 passes in five weeks. Both his 71.0 completion percentage and 8.4 YPA were his highest marks in that timespan. Fear of Henry was a theme on Tannehill's first score, where Jonnu Smith was allowed to roam too freely in the end zone. For No. 2, a 14-yarder in the fourth quarter, A.J. Brown did all the work after the catch. Tannehill's interception was a really bad decision with pressure in his face. He essentially threw the ball right to a dropping Tyus Bowser. Tannehill isn't matching his 2019 efficiency, but he continues to play better than he ever did with the Dolphins. That is enough for the Titans. For Week 12, Tannehill rematches with a stout Colts defense that limited him to 147 Week 10 yards.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

Lock also had 61 of his yards come on the final meaningless last-play heave to Tim Patrick to run out the clock. Lock has just seven touchdown passes on the season to go with 11 interceptions. He's very likely not the future in Denver and won't be a fantasy option at all next week against the Saints.\n",

    "analysis": "Cook plunged in for a one-yard touchdown after Adam Thielen was tackled at the goal line, giving the former a league-leading 13 rushing scores through Minnesota's first 10 games; the last player to have more rushing touchdowns\u00a0in a team's first 10 games was LaDainian Tomlinson in 2006 (19).\u00a0Cook has also experienced a slight role change since returning from injury, handling at least 32 touches in 3-of-4 games in that span. Alexander Mattison has merely touched the ball 18 times behind Cook (122) during\u00a0that four-game stretch. With a workload that exceeds both Alvin Kamara's and Derrick Henry's usage, Cook is vividly setup to close the year as the overall RB1 in fantasy.\n",

Moss hasn't found the end zone in two straight games but has quietly\u00a0out-carried (16-6) and out-touched (19-10) teammate Devin Singletary in that stint. This backfield's lack of production can be attributed to OC Brian Daboll's play-calling during that stretch\u00a0as he's leaned on Josh Allen for 87 attempts to 22 running back carries in that time. Moss is still\u00a0the player to roster for re-draft leagues over Singletary for the rest of the year.\u00a0\n",

No other Jacksonville player recorded a carry and all three of Devine Ozigbo's targets came on the team's final drive. They were down by 24 points at the time. Robinson remains an RB1 despite the lacking performances from his offense as a whole.\n",

It's possible the Panthers get McCaffrey back from his shoulder injury\u00a0next week. If not, Davis will remain a plug-in RB2.\n",

It was a euphoric capstone to an effort that saw him stood up by a tough run defense and vultured for multiple scores by non-running backs. There was a scary moment in the second half where Henry appeared to wreck his shoulder, but he ended up only missing a play or two. Now over 1,000 yards rushing on the season, Henry has gone over 100 yards on the ground in 6-of-10 appearances. Beastly. The Colts' elite defense is on tap for Week 12.\u00a0\n",

He also nearly cost the Broncos the game with a lost fumble at the Miami one-yard line deep in the fourth quarter where Miami drove all the way down the field only to throw an end-zone interception. Gordon is tied with Ezekiel Elliott for the league lead with four lost fumbles and has just one 100-yard game on the year. Lindsay is the more talented back at this stage of their respective careers, but the Broncos paid Gordon to be their No. 1 back. He'll be a low-floor RB2 next week against the Saints.\n",

While every Bear not named Allen Robinson should be faded in fantasy, Patterson makes for a interesting waiver add in larger leagues with multiple flex spots.\u00a0\n",

The 49ers badly, badly need a boost in the backfield, where Jerick McKinnon is not hacking it on early downs and JaMycal Hasty just landed on injured reserve. By far the best running back on the roster, Mostert has not played since Week 6. Mostert handling the mail with Coleman and McKinnon mixing in as change-of-paces would be the backfield the Niners originally envisioned before injuries decimated the offense. Mostert will return to RB2 status.\u00a0\n",

Nyheim Hines had 10 opportunities. Jordan Wilkins had 5. It's a sign of life for Taylor's RB2 chances down the stretch, but the coaching staff has been hellbent on riding the hot hand on a week by week basis. The Colts have the potential to be a well-orchestrated offense down the stretch, and Taylor has theoretical upside despite busting through the first nine weeks of the season. Taylor is a boom-bust RB2/3 against the Titans for Week 12.\n",

It helps balance out the lack of touches, though the 14 carries were by far his most since Bell's arrival. In the four games with Bell, CEH is averaging 10.25 touches. That makes the rookie a low-floor, high-upside RB2 for Week 12 against a tough Bucs defense.\n",

Ballage was banged up both early and late, briefly checking out on the Chargers' opening and closing drives. With Justin Jackson out at least one more game and Austin Ekeler's whereabouts unknown, Ballage figures to retain a hammer lock on touches over Joshua Kelley and Troymaine Pope vs. the Bills' under-performing defense in Week 12. It's the most 2020 of developments, but Ballage is a locked-in RB2 for as long as Jackson and Ekeler remain\u00a0sidelined.\u00a0\n",

Neither were used in the receiving game, combining for\u00a0three targets on Taysom Hill's 23 attempts, but Kamara likely would have been deployed\u00a0for his normal role had he truly been healthy. Murray instead played the entire first series for the Saints and opened the second half with a 25-yard reception and 11-yard run.

Lindsay still looks like the far superior running back based on talent. He still has minimal fantasy value in an offense that is going to struggle to keep up on the scoreboard most weeks.

Mostert handling the mail with Coleman and McKinnon mixing in as change-of-paces would be the backfield the Niners originally envisioned before injuries decimated the offense.

Active for the first time since Week 7, Hyde got the start with Chris Carson (foot) still on the shelf. The Seahawks were ready to move on from DeeJay Dallas/Travis Homer/Alex Collins and Hyde made it easy, ripping a number of nice early gains as the Seahawks \"established the run\" for one of the only times all season. It clearly took pressure off Russell Wilson coming off two turnover-marred disasters. This should not and will not be for the formula for the Seahawks going forward, but it made sense on a short week in the context of their past two games. Hyde's going-forward value will be entirely dependent on Carson's health, who has 11 more days to get cleared for Week 12 Monday Night Football vs. Philadelphia. Hyde will be a barely-there FLEX if Carson suits up.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "He mustered only 22 snaps on Sunday after suffering his\u00a0injury in the first quarter. Jones returned to make a 22-yard catch on 4th-and-13 in garbage time but was removed from the game shortly thereafter with a noticeable limp. We've seen Morris hold Jones out of practice until Friday and still remove him from the injury report, so Atlanta's Friday practice will ultimately tell fantasy players whether Jones will be available on Sunday. Reminder that\u00a0Matt Ryan was previously the QB27, QB23, and QB26 in three games that Jones was either absent or limited for earlier this year.\n",

That is not anything new for the Titans' second-year pro, but this was his new signature score. The 6-foot-1 wideout simply will not go down. The Titans need to continue to work on finding ways to get the ball in his hands. Brown has yet to have a double-digit target effort this season, and has zero rushing attempts. He will remain on the WR1/2 borderline for Week 12's tough matchup with the Colts, who held Brown to 1/21 in Week 10.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Jefferson was spotted wide open downfield for a 39-yard touchdown (and proceeded to do The Griddy) following a play-action pass from Kirk Cousins. Even so, Adam Thielen was found for two touchdowns since he's been concertedly looked at for more red zone (13-1) and end zone (13-1) targets than Jefferson since Week 3 \u2014 when Jefferson was initially started in two-wide sets. Week 12 against the Panthers is still a terrific spot for the rookie, who currently leads the league in yards per route run, since the Panthers have permitted the sixth-most catches to enemy wideouts.\n",

Ridley previously averaged 11.5 targets per game and a 30.6% target share in his two starts without Jones this year and would remain a strong usage-based WR1 no matter what happens to Ryan and Atlanta's offense if Jones were to miss any\u00a0time.\n",

Thomas also dropped a pass mid-game\u00a0that would've resulted in 10-plus yards.\u00a0The next closest in targets (5) was Sanders with less than half of Thomas' opportunities.

Vincent Jackson ('14) and Kendall Wright ('13) each had 2 TDs.\" It's not the best company for Anderson. He'll\u00a0maintain his status as a high-end WR3 in Week 12 against Minnesota.\u00a0\n",

Kupp has been Jared Goff's favorite target all season, and he was killing the Bucs after the catch Monday night. Kupp now has three 100-yard games in 2020 and gets a Week 12 date with the 49ers. Kupp went 3-11-0 on nine targets against San Francisco in Week 6. Kupp should be treated as a weekly WR2 with the Rams opening up their passing game of late.\n",

    "analysis": "Lamb's lone touchdown was a highlight reel catch that saw him grip the ball behind rookie Jeff Gladney while the former was falling onto his back in the corner of the end zone. The Cowboys also featured Lamb for a couple of jet sweeps as it was clear the team wanted to integrate him into the offense in a variety of ways. Although his targets from the slot have been shallower than Michael Gallup's this year, Lamb's floor remains safer ahead of Thursday's matchup against Washington. All three of Dallas' receivers will be in play for the three-game DFS holiday slate.\n",

His 9.1 yards per target and 11.3 yards per reception are career lows. Last year, he averaged 11 yards per target and 15.5 yards per catch. Godwin's air yards per target (8.2) is below short pass vacuums like Jamison Crowder, Jarvis Landry, and Tyler Boyd. His short range usage was on full display Monday night against the Rams, when Godwin caught seven passes for 53\u00a0yards with an average yards per target of 5.3. Even with a capped weekly ceiling, Godwin remains a high-end WR2 in PPR formats.\u00a0\n",

Sunday was still Beasley's third 100-yard game of the season, at one point putting\u00a0Patrick Peterson on skates during a deep crossing route that resulted in a 22-yard score\u00a0\u2014 the first of two instances\u00a0that Peterson was dusted for a touchdown on Sunday. Beasley previously averaged the 16th-most fantasy points per game among wideouts in the two contests Brown missed earlier this year and would be in line for additional opportunities if the latter isn't cleared following Buffalo's Week 11 bye. It's something to monitor when the Bills return to practice in a couple of weeks.\n",

If either of those two things doesn't happen, Cole can be kept off fantasy rosters.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Perriman's touchdown was a third quarter 49-yarder where he ran a go route and got a step on\u00a0Casey Hayward, who had a bad game. Deep threat Perriman now has three touchdowns over his past two contests, both of which were started by Joe Flacco. The Jets are hoping Sam Darnold (shoulder) can return for Week 12 against the Dolphins' elite defense. No matter who is under center, Perriman will remain a high-risk, high-reward WR4. That's doubly true since bye weeks are over and the fantasy player pool will include all 32 teams.\u00a0\n",

Only active for the past month, Mims has cleared 40 yards in all four of his appearances, teasing big-play ability out of his 6-foot-3 frame. He is absolutely appearing worth the second-round pick. Mims is an exciting hold in Dynasty leagues who has a rough Week 12 matchup in the Dolphins.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "It was Andrews' best game of the season. The under-performing seam stretcher has emerged as something of a bright spot over the Ravens' past two losses, catching 12 balls for 157 yards and his sixth touchdown. Today's score was a 31-yarder where Lamar Jackson dropped a dime in the bucket near the goal line. Of course, Jackson also missed Andrews on a potential red zone score earlier in the proceedings. Jackson is leaving a ton of yardage on the field, but the gains he actually makes have typically been going to Andrews. He will be a top-three option for Thursday's Thanksgiving showdown with the Steelers.\u00a0\n",

The difference, of course, has been touchdowns: Smith has two scores since Week 7 while Firkser has none. Titans beat writers have said in recent weeks that the team views Firkser as a pass-catching tight end who will stay involved in the offense.

From Week 12 on, Smith posted a 30-267-3 line on 41 targets, averaging 6.8 looks per game in that span.  Smith was a sixth-round pick of the Niners back in April and stands 6'5/255.  He ran insanely slow with a 4.92 forty in the pre-draft process, but perhaps the Giants found a long-term No. 2 to Engram.\n",
