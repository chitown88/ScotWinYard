Sometimes, that works out like his second-quarter touchdown to Hollywood Brown between multiple defenders early in the second quarter. Sometimes, it doesn't like when Jackson was picked in two of three possessions to end the first half. Jackson's value will always be high because of his ability to use his legs, but five picks in his past two games after none in the season's opening three weeks is certainly a disturbing trend. Things should ease up Sunday against a winless Bengals squad."

However, he made adjustments, and on the third drive he rolled out to his left, patiently waited for his moment and lofted a pass where only Tyler Lockett could catch it for the game's first touchdown. Wilson ended up throwing three more scores, including a game-winner to Chris Carson with 2:28 remaining in regulation. He finished the contest with a season-high 11.7 yards per attempt, and this was the fourth time in five games he completed over 70 percent of his passes.

Most importantly for Watson, the Texans, and his fantasy owners, the quarterback was not sacked and was hit just once. He entered the game having been sacked 18 times. The return of guard Zach Fulton re-established the front five that protected Watson two weeks ago against the Chargers, which was the unit's best performance to that point in the season. In that game, the offensive line allowed two sacks and one quarterback hit in 34 dropbacks. A Week 6 showdown against the Chiefs and their league-leading passing offense could lead to a shootout and another banner day for Watson."

        "report": "Coach Ron Rivera confirmed that Allen would remain Carolina's starting quarterback for Sunday's game against the Buccaneers with Cam Newton (foot) not scheduled to join the Panthers in London, Brendan Marks of The Charlotte Observer reports.",
        "analysis": "Newton's slim chance at playing in Week 6 improved Tuesday after he was spotted at practice without a walking boot on his left foot, but Rivera quickly dismissed the notion of the signal-caller returning after a three-game absence due to the Lisfranc injury. Allen's fourth start of the season thus awaits him in London, where he'll look to shake off two straight lackluster outings in which he's combined to account for only one touchdown against three turnovers (all lost fumbles) while averaging a pedestrian 6.4 yards per attempt. The Panthers have still notched a win I each of the past two weeks largely on the Herculean efforts of Christian McCaffrey, who has shouldered an even heavier load than normal (46 carries, 16 receptions) during that stretch."

Stafford has, strangely, dominated in Detroit's loss and tie while putting up so-so numbers in the two wins. One thing to track heading into Week 6 against the Packers is the play of Kerryon Johnson, who finally seemed to find his footing against the Chiefs. If Johnson is able to keep it going, pressure to carry the offense will be lifted off of Stafford's shoulders."

Much like the player he's filling in for, Bridgewater displayed spectacular chemistry with Michael Thomas, connecting with the All-Pro receiver for 11 completions, 182 yards and touchdown passes of 14 and 12 yards. Brees resumed throwing this past week, but he likely still remains at least a couple of weeks away from returning in a best-case scenario. Therefore, Bridgewater will have a chance to build on his stellar effort when he faces the Jaguars in Week 6."

With no listed injuries to contend with now, however, Mayfield can practice fully this week in the hopes of bouncing back Sunday against the 4-1 Seahawks, who have given up an average of 270.6 passing yards per game to date."

He also took four sacks in this rough performance, with the only real highlight of his day coming on a 35-yard touchdown to Darius Slayton in the second quarter. Jones' output has diminished each of the last three weeks, which can partly be attributed to the matchups he's faced. He'll face his toughest one yet Thursday against the Patriots."

The fourth-year quarterback now has 117 pass attempts in the last pair of contests following Thursday's hefty workload, once again largely necessitated by the stumbles of the Rams' defense. Goff connected with seven different pass catchers on the night and showed outstanding chemistry with tight end Gerald Everett, who racked up a game-high 136 yards. Goff also had to endure the early exit of Brandin Cooks, who left the game for good in the second half to be evaluated for a concussion. Ultimately, Goff put the Rams in position for a narrow win by spearheading a 10-play, 67-yard drive that set Greg Zuerlein up for a would-be game-winning 44-yard field goal that went wide right with 11 seconds remaining. In the wake of back-to-back crushing losses, Goff and his teammates will look to regroup ahead of a Week 6 divisional clash versus the 49ers a week from Sunday."

Carson looks like the bell cow, and any worries of Rashaad Penny cutting into Carson's workload can be safely brushed aside for now, as Penny was simply a change-of-pace back with six carries for 18 yards."

The jet-heeled tailback then followed that with a five-yard touchdown catch two drives later. Overall, those contributions fueled Breida's impressive performance, which came while fellow tailback Tevin Coleman returned to the fold following an ankle injury. In his first action since Week 1, Coleman actually led the Niners with 16 carries, gaining 97 yards and scoring once himself. Going forward, it'll be interesting to see how Breida and Coleman split snaps in the backfield, but considering they play in arguably the league's best running scheme -- albeit now potentially without fullback Kyle Juszczyk, who left injured Monday -- there could be enough production to go around for both of them to retain formidable fantasy value."

He may have turned a corner Sunday and just in time as the Lions next play a Packers team in Week 6 that -- while tough to start the season -- has been exposed in the running game."

This was an encouraging sign for Ekeler, who received a hefty workload of his own despite 16 touches for Gordon. He should hold onto a similar role for next Sunday's home matchup with the Steelers, but a similar output isn't guaranteed."

Not only did Coleman lead the Niners in carries, topping the 11 on which Breida gained 114 yards, but he also scored from 19 yards to end the second quarter. Overall, coach Kyle Shanahan's patented running scheme consistently gashed the Browns defense, enabling both Coleman and Breida to turn in stellar showings. Although fullback Kyle Juszczyk getting injured late could be a development to monitor, thus far it seems Shanahan can get high production from whoever carries the ball, making Coleman and Breida both fairly valuable despite their expected split of snaps going forward."

The receiving specialist also set a new season high in carries, perhaps because third-stringer Rex Burkhead (foot) was unavailable to fill his usual change-of-pace role behind White and Sony Michel. With wide receiver Phillip Dorsett leaving this game due to a hamstring injury, the trio of White, Edelman and Gordon represent the clear-cut top options in New England's passing game heading into Thursday's game against the Giants."

While the absence of slot receiver Danny Amendola (chest) likely played a role in the distribution of playing time, McKissic arguably flashed more as a runner than as a receiver thanks to a team-high 26-yard scamper in the third quarter.

He averaged a respectable 4.7 yards per carry against a tough Chargers front despite breaking off a long gain of just 11 yards. Freeman, who is averaging 4.5 yards per carry this season, continues to see Phillip Lindsay shine out of the backfield, but he should still see double-digit touches in next week's home matchup against the Titans."

        "analysis": "On the surface, it looks like Browns offensive coordinator Todd Monken followed through on his statement to Andrew Gribble of the Browns' official site earlier this week to get Hilliard more involved Week 4. After playing just one offensive snap last week, the second-year back was on the field for 25 plays and had eight total touches. However, five of his six carries and his touchdown came on the Browns' final drive  as they were up by two scores late and finished off the victory. This is still a backfield very much dominated by Nick Chubb."

Playing behind a do-it-all back in Dalvin Cook, Mattison is averaging just seven touches per game, but he's yielding quality results with an average of 5.6 yards per carry. Despite playing second fiddle to Cook, the rookie maintains value on a run-first team.

If that's the case, the Giants will count Penny and Jon Hilliman as the lone healthy backfield options on the 53-man roster, though the team would almost certainly promote Austin Walter from the practice squad before Thursday to provide additional depth. Though he's listed as a fullback, Penny spent the first two years in the pro ranks as a tailback and owns a 3.9 yards-per-carry mark over 46 career totes. Considering that Hilliman is an undrafted rookie who has delivered underwhelming production to date, it wouldn't be surprising if the Giants ultimately chose to lean more heavily on Penny as Thursday's contest unfolds."

With a nine-catch, 95-yard performance against the Cowboys in Week 4 having preceded this performance, it's clear Thomas' fantasy value essentially remains almost as robust with Bridgewater under center as with Brees.

        "analysis": "Boyd has once again been a tremendous high-floor option, with six or more receptions in four games already in 2019. His touchdown catch snapped a four-game drought, and the 123 receiving yards were his most since Week 8 of last season. With A.J. Green (ankle) remaining week-to-week but not yet returned, and John Ross (shoulder) landing on injured reserve Wednesday, Boyd will continue to be a viable fantasy threat by virtue of a high-volume target share. In Week 6, he and the Bengals' receiving corps will be opposing a Ravens defense that contained Pittsburgh to 203 passing yards as a team, but allowed JuJu Smith-Schuster to rack up seven receptions for 75 yards and a TD on Sunday."

That is in line with many of the other Chargers players' outputs, as Philip Rivers finished averaging just 4.4 yards per attempt without any plays longer than 20 yards. Albeit in a tricky matchup, this effort was likely even more disappointing than his five-catch, 48-yard performance against the lowly Dolphins a week ago.

He's played at least 60 percent of Atlanta's offensive snaps in every game thus far in 2019, with nearly eight targets per game if excluding his enigmatic one-target outing in Week 3. Ridley and the Falcons' receiving corps prepare to take on a Cardinals defense that has allowed multiple passing touchdowns in every game but one thus far this season."

While his 4.34 40-yard dash time is the highlight of his profile, Chark has proven to be far more than just a burner by racking up eight or more targets in three of his last four games. Now that he's emerged as Gardner Minshew's top target, he'll look to keep things going in Week 6 against the Saints."

His limited participation in practice to begin the week is a step in the right direction, but it's worth keeping in mind that in order to suit up Week 6 against the undefeated 49ers, Cooks would need to fully clear the league's five-step protocol. His final task will be to receive medical clearance from an independent neurologist. If Cooks were forced to miss any time, the Rams would rely on Cooper Kupp, Robert Woods and Gerald Everett to lead the aerial attack."

In Week 6, the Titans will travel to Denver in what projects to be another slow-paced and low-scoring matchup, meaning Brown isn't likely to see an uptick in volume."

There could be more targets available for Samuel and his fellow auxiliary options against an uncharacteristically poor Rams passing defense next week, but there is too much risk here to gamble outside of deeper leagues."

However, Pettis had a golden opportunity to potentially score a touchdown in garbage time, but he suffered a costly drop in a situation with plenty of open field ahead of him.

Although Wright posted a season-high five catches in Week 4, his role as a complementary veteran in an offense lacking variety leaves him prone to performances like Sunday's relatively often."

Coutee showed flashes of fantasy prominence with three performances of five-plus receptions and 50 or more receiving yards as a rookie, but ultimately he saw his season derailed by a hamstring injury. Currently standing as the No. 3 or 4 wideout in Houston's offense depending on the status of Stills, Coutee will carry value as long as Deshaun Watson is producing 300-yard, three-touchdown passing outings. That has a strong chance to continue in Week 6 as the Texans take on a Kansas City defense that has surrendered seven touchdown passes coming into Sunday Night Football, with six going to wide receivers."

The promising third-year pro has seen his yardage totals drop over that of the previous game in each of the last two weeks, an unfavorable trend that's also applied to his targets over that span. Howard was far from the only Buccaneers pass catcher to disappoint Sunday, but in his case, the muted production has been a worrisome season-long trend. Howard will look for his first breakout game of the season across the pond against the Panthers during a Week 6 divisional showdown in London."

Higbee has a respectable 10 targets over the last two games, but those have been parlayed into a modest seven receptions for 88 yards. Meanwhile, Everett has logged 19 looks over the same span, turning those into 12 catches, 180 yards and a touchdown. It remains to be seen if Higbee continues to be utilized in more of a possession role over the long term, with the next opportunity to find out on the field coming in a Week 6 divisional battle versus the 49ers a week from Sunday."
