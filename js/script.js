It's the second straight week Mahomes has received an early breather, though unlike Week 7 in Denver, he heads to the bench with monster fantasy numbers. Mahomes decked Gregg Williams' pathetic defense for scores of 30, 36, three, 26 and 41 yards. The first was a Mecole Hardman jet sweep that Mahomes got credit for, while the fifth was a bomb down the left sideline where Tyreek Hill got a step on a falling Bless Austin. No. 3 was an underhanded softball-type pitch to Travis Kelce near the goal line. Mahomes will enter his Week 9 start against the Panthers with 21 touchdowns compared to one pick. He is on pace for 4,630 yards at the season's midway point. Those numbers are like Aaron Rodgers in his prime, though still off Mahomes' MVP 2018.\u00a0\n",

Without Michael Thomas (hamstring) and Emmanuel Sanders (COVID), Brees managed to find Jared Cook wide open in the end zone for a 16-yard touchdown then Taysom Hill in the final quarter to give the Saints a two-score lead. He also moved ahead of Tom Brady (for the time being) with 560 career touchdown passes. Hopefully some of Brees'\u00a0wobbly throws were due to the frigid wind in Chicago and not because of his lacking arm strength since Tampa Bay's stifling secondary is on deck for Week 9.\n",

Herbert also rushed for 21 yards on three attempts. The third-quarter end-zone pick, however, proved costly in the end. Still, this loss can't go on Herbert.

The Evans one was a perfectly-thrown fade over the top of CB James Bradberry. Brady has multiple touchdown passes in 6-of-8 games and has settled in as a solid floor way with an elevated ceiling as a QB1. He'll get Antonio Brown added to his arsenal in Week 9 against the Saints, and Chris Godwin also hopes to return from his broken index finger.\n",

That has been killing his fantasy value. Losing Calvin Ridley to an ankle injury isn't going to help, though Ridley has 10 days to get cleared for next week's matchup with the Broncos.

Cousins took a backseat, attempting a season-low in passes; his longest completion\u00a0was actually a screen pass that Cook turned upfield for a 50-yard touchdown in the first half. As always with Cousins, his production comes\u00a0down to whether or not he's\u00a0forced to pass (and he wasn't on Sunday). He'll again be ranked as a high floor QB2 in Week 9 against the Lions.\n",

Foles\u00a0also had a wobbly near-interception dropped by Marshon Lattimore in the fourth quarter. All in all, it was another underwhelming performance\u00a0from the 31-year-old veteran who at least took advantage of New Orleans' struggling secondary. Week 9 offers another cush matchup against Tennessee's defense, but fantasy players can't chase Foles' production from this one since he's still just a bad\u00a0play or two\u00a0away from being benched in favor of Mitchell Trubisky.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Lock entered this one without a touchdown pass since Week 1 and a 0:4 TD:INT mark in that span. The first half looked like much of the same with Lock going 9-of-15 for 58 scoreless yards at the break. But the Chargers ended up blowing a 21-point lead, and Lock was a big part of it on the stat sheet. His three fourth-quarter touchdowns went to Albert\u00a0Okwuegbunam (9 yards), DaeSean Hamilton (40), and the game-winner to KJ Hamler (1) as time expired. Lock has been mostly bad as a sophomore, but he made the throws in the final 15 minutes of this one. Lock gets an easy draw in Atlanta for Week 9 but still won't be anything more than a recommended back-end QB2.\n",

Tannehill was lucky to escape with only one pick, having a second undone by a Bengals neutral zone infraction. For score No. 1, A.J. Brown did all the work after the catch. For No. 2, Corey Davis made a sensational grab in the front right corner of the end zone. Despite the rough stretch, this has not had the feel of Tannehill getting \"exposed\" or whatever you might want to call it. That being said, Tannehill will have a difficult time snapping his mini slump in Week 9, where the Titans will be hosting the Bears' strong defense. He will be more of a QB2 than QB1 for that one.\u00a0\n",

Jones' 256 passing yards go down as his most since Week 1, but he was mostly bad in this one and should've thrown two or three more interceptions. Turnovers have always been Jones' problem, as he tends to make some of the dumbest decisions we see week in and week out at the quarterback position, constantly making idiotic throws into coverage. Darius Slayton bailed him out late in the fourth quarter on a drive where Jones ended it with a perfect throw to Golden Tate for a 19-yard score. Jones' throw on the ensuing two-point conversion attempt to tie the game, however, was way off the mark to Dion Lewis, who was open in the end zone. Jones just isn't very good and is probably flirting with getting benched. The Giants go to Washington in Week 9.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "The rookie struggled mightily in his first career start, completing 12 of 22 passes for 93 yards and a touchdown against the Rams. He received the second lowest Week 8 passing grade from Pro Football Focus. Gailey said Sunday's experience was \"invaluable\" for Tua, stressing that he would require more reps to improve his timing. Week 9 will see Tua go against the Cardinals' top-10 pass defense -- one that has allowed the seventh lowest completion rate to opposing passers. Gailey said the playbook would expand in Tua's coming starts, including more run-pass option play calls. Unlike Week 8, Miami won't be able to hide their inexperienced quarterback thanks to a big lead. Fantasy managers should avoid the rookie in all but the deepest superflex formats.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "The yardage output was Bridgewater's lowest of the season on a night where he almost didn't make it 60 minutes. Egregiously tripped on a late third quarter scramble, Bridgewater busted loose to slide only to take a sickening head shot from DE Charles Harris. Harris was ejected, but Bridgewater missed multiple plays as he was evaluated for a concussion and got his neck stretched out. He was officially announced with a neck ailment before returning after P.J. Walker ran the offense for a few minutes. Whereas Walker immediately tried to make a few things happen down the field, Bridgewater was even more conservative than usual this evening, failing to get anything going deep until the game's dying moments. By then it was too late. Bridgewater did not look the same after returning from his neck injury, dialing up one checkdown after another behind a shaky offensive line. Bridgewater has helped get Curtis Samuel going the past two weeks, but Robby Anderson and D.J. Moore both had quiet games tonight. Offering decent floor but zero upside, Bridgewater will be a top 15-16 option for Week 9 against the Chiefs.\u00a0\n",

He also became the third player in franchise history to record four touchdowns\u00a0in a single game. Cook admittedly looked incredible on Sunday, clearly over his groin injury that limited him in practice throughout the week. He also handled 32 of the team's 35 backfield touches and accounted for 226 of the Vikings' 324 net yards on offense. He'll again be a top-three option for fantasy in Week 9 against the Lions.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Gurley was not targeted in the passing game for the first time since Week 2. It was another bizarre game for Gurley, who disappeared for a long stretch in the first half seemingly without injury. Gurley was struggling and coach Raheem Morris seemed to want to see what Brian Hill could do. Hill looked far more explosive than his veteran teammate, logging nine more yards on seven fewer carries, but Gurley eventually returned like nothing had happened. Four days after scoring a game-losing\u00a0touchdown against the Lions, Gurley committed another horrible late-game gaffe when he went out of bounds on third down with 3:11 remaining. The Falcons were trying to run out the clock/make the Panthers burn timeouts. Morris can't be pleased. Gurley still does fine when the Falcons dial up a stretch run, but he has almost zero lateral agility remaining. He will remain a workload-based RB2 for Week 9 against the Broncos.\u00a0\n",

After Jackson was the guy in the first game sans Austin Ekeler (hamstring, I.R.) against the Saints, Jackson took a back seat to Joshua Kelley in Week 7, but it was Jackson again in this one. Even Troymaine Pope out-touched Kelley in this one. Jackson has looked good with his opportunities over the last few weeks and would seem to be the favorite to lead this backfield until Ekeler returns. He's also seen 17 targets over the last three games. Jackson will be a back-end RB2 with upside next week against the Raiders.\n",

    "analysis": "Speaking Tuesday, coach Kyle Shanahan said that Coleman will be out a \"little bit of time,\" but he has avoided injured reserve for the time being. Shanahan expects practice squad RB Austin Walter to be promoted behind JaMycal Hasty and Jerick McKinnon. Hasty will be the strongest fantasy play against the Packers' struggling defense, with McKinnon offering low-end FLEX appeal in PPR leagues. For his part, injury-prone and ineffective Coleman is a tenuous hold in 10-12 team leagues with injury and bye week roster crunches mounting.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Gaskin will presumably be stashed on injured reserve. The Dolphins acquired Chiefs RB DeAndre Washington out of left field on Tuesday. Now we know why. It's a big blow for the Dolphins, as Gaskin has become their clear-cut lead back, to the point where Jordan Howard has been a healthy scratch. OC Chain Gailey will now be forced to duct tape and glue a backfield together out of Howard, Matt Breida, Patrick Laird and Washington. It's a supremely unimpressive collection of talent. Howard will offer last-ditch RB3/FLEX appeal, though hopefully Breida will be the touch leader. Breida is worth a gander in the majority of leagues where he is on the waiver wire. If Gaskin adheres to his timeline, he will miss games against the Cardinals, Chargers and Broncos before returning in Week 12 against the lowly Jets. However, it's unlikely he will simply slide back into his old role at that point, making him an uncertain hold in 10-12 team leagues.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

Evans' yards haven't been there this year, but he's been one of the premier red-zone dominators in the scoring area with Brady. With Antonio Brown and Chris Godwin debuting and coming back, respectively, in the very near future, Evans faces even more competition for targets, but he and Rob Gronkowski should remain Brady's favorite red-zone targets. Evans will be more of a boom-bust WR2 next week against the Saints.\n",

He's unsurprisingly recorded double-digit targets (17, 10, 16, 12) in every game he's finished\u00a0this year. Adams remains fantasy's overall WR1 as long as he's fully healthy.\n",

The bad news is, Matt Ryan failed to connect with his alpha wideout on not one, not two, but three end zone targets. The force field was back this evening. Jones' output was likely also affected by rain that really picked up after halftime. The big going forward takeaway was Calvin Ridley departing with an ankle injury. It did not have the looks of a season ender, but the Falcons head on bye after next week's date with the Broncos. Ridley is probably on the wrong side of questionable for Week 9. Jones will remain a locked-in top-three WR1.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Gregg Williams' barely-there defense sprung Hill for his season-best day even though Patrick Mahomes and a host of starters rested for the final 10 minutes of the game. Hill's yardage was one off his 2020 best from Week 2, though the two-score effort was his first of the year. Hill found the end zone from 36 and 41 yards out. The 36-yarder was a laser where Hill split a pair of DBs. The 41-yarder was a strike down the left sideline where Hill bested a falling Bless Austin. With 50 percent of 2020 now in the books, Hill is on pace for 70/1,074/14. Hill is a good bet to overshoot those first two totals. The Panthers, who sell out to limit big plays, are on deck before the Chiefs' Week 10 bye.\u00a0\n",

That was all she wrote for a player who entered the evening with three straight 93-yard performances. Amazingly, Moore's six targets this evening were actually second most in his past four games. Robby Anderson once again led the Panthers in looks. Frustrating, but Moore is doing enough damage down the field to keep himself in the top 12-18 on a weekly basis.

Baltimore's banged up offensive line could lead to an overtly run heavy offense for the remainder of the year, raising questions about whether the Ravens offense can support even one reliable fantasy pass catcher. Brown is a boom-bust weekly option.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Like a majority of wideouts against Marshon Lattimore and Janoris Jenkins this year, Mooney took advantage of the matchup in beating the latter for a 50-yard gain \u2014 Chicago's longest play on offense all year \u2014 in the second quarter. His three-yard touchdown along the sideline helped bring the Bears within a field goal with only 6:25 remaining in the final quarter. Fantasy players should still note that Anthony Miller (8/73) was actually used over Mooney on Sunday, collecting a team-high 11 targets on 85% of Nick Foles' dropbacks. That will be something to monitor moving forward as one of the two behind Allen Robinson offer deep league value if able to separate from the other in two-wide sets down the stretch.\n",

As long as Johnson is healthy, Claypool will probably be a more volatile producer than fantasy managers would prefer. He has a prime Week 9 matchup against Dallas.\u00a0\n",

The rushing touchdown again came with Samuel lined up as a true running back. He looked like a natural on the 12-yard weave to the goal line. The Panthers are forcing the issue with Samuel since his return from his knee ailment, but there still aren't a ton of looks to go around behind Robby Anderson and D.J. Moore. Samuel is an upside WR4 you can start in a bye week or injury pinch. There are worse things in fantasy. The Chiefs are on deck for Week 9.\u00a0\n",

Justin Herbert tried to hit him again in the end zone in the fourth quarter on a jump-ball, but Bryce Callahan ended up picking it off. Williams has three sub-20 yards games this season but has as high of a ceiling as most wideouts. His weekly range of outcomes is just so wide, making him a boom-bust WR3 most Sundays. Williams will have an easier Week 9 matchup against the Raiders.\n",

Cook will remain a low-end TE1 in Week 9 against the Bucs if only for the surrounding game environment and lack of viable receivers around him.\n",

    "analysis": "Witten spent 16 seasons with the Cowboys from 2003-2019. The most-recent version of the veteran TE wasn't all that great, as Witten set career-low marks in both yards per reception (8.4) and yards per target (6.4) in 2019. The fit with the Raiders is even more puzzling considering the presence of both Darren Waller and Foster Moreau. It's unlikely that Witten sees enough targets and snaps to work as a standalone fantasy option in 2020, but his presence undoubtedly lowers the ceiling of both Waller and Moreau.\n",

    "analysis": "The New York Daily News created a Tuesday morning stir when it reported the Jets were shopping Williams \"with the hope of moving him\" before next week's deadline, but it was quickly refuted by Cimini and another Daily News reporter. Even for a rebuilding team, it would make almost literally zero sense. Williams' career is off to a strong start and he is not yet 23. It would have to be a Jamal Adams-style haul for the Jets to even consider it, but the Daily News' original report said that was not the case. If true, it is completely baffling.\u00a0\n",

He was not playing well this season before the trade, but this isn't the first time the Saints have made a \"change of scenery\"-type acquisition\u00a0on defense over the past few seasons. In theory, 26-year-old Alexander still offers upside on all three downs, but his career has mostly been an injury-plagued, inconsistent mess.\u00a0\n",
