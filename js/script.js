    "analysis": "It's Week 1, but tonight will go down as one of the fantasy games of the year, with both the Bucs and Cowboys simply exploding the box score. The 379 yards were Brady's third most as a Buc during the regular season, though he has now reached that mark in three of his past four games, never compiling fewer than 348 in that span. He relentlessly worked his connections with Chris Godwin, Antonio Brown and Rob Gronkowski, and could have had an even bigger night had Godwin not dropped a 46-yard touchdown on a somewhat difficult play. Neither of Brady's \"interceptions\" were his fault, with the first clanging off of Leonard Fournette's stone hands and the second coming on a first half Hail Mary. The biggest play of the night was Brady's 47-yard touchdown strike to AB in the second quarter, where AB stole Anthony Brown's soul and Brady found him along the sideline. Brady's arm looked as strong as it has his entire time in Tampa. The man is simply a freak at 44 years of age. He's going to immolate the Falcons on 10 days rest in Week 2.\u00a0\n",

Kansas City was out-gained 318 yards to 183 in the first half, facing a 22-10 deficit out of the intermission, but responded with an 11-yard strike to Travis Kelce (6/76/2) in the third quarter and eventually, a 75-yard bomb to Tyreek Hill (11/197/1) to come within two points. Kelce's second touchdown on the afternoon, an eight-yard catch underneath with 1:32 left to play, ultimately sealed the deal for Kansas City before CB Mike Hughes picked off Baker Mayfield on the final drive. Even at their best, Cleveland's defense wasn't enough to stop Mahomes from compiling QB1 numbers \u2014 a trend that should continue into Week 2 against Baltimore's defensive unit. He'll again be ranked as a top-two option in that matchup.\n",

Goff started his day with a six-yard touchdown to T.J. Hockenson but then tossed a pick-six to Dre Greenlaw five minutes later in the second quarter to put the Lions in a 28-10 hole. Trailing 38-10, Goff then hit D'Andre Swift on a screen for a 43-yard score where Swift did all the work. The third score was a meaningless hookup to Quintze Cephus late in the fourth frame. Goff won't be a recommended fantasy option next Monday night against the Packers.\n",

Carr's\u00a0first touchdown was a 10-yard hookup with Darren Waller in the fourth quarter, and the second was the game-winning 31-yarder to Zay Jones in overtime with Carr fading away and Jones running free behind the defense. His interception was nearly a back-breaker at the goal line in overtime when Carr's pass went through Willie Snead's hands and popped into the air for a pick in the end zone. The Raiders got it back a couple plays later on a Lamar Jackson fumble. Carr will be a back-end QB2 for Week 2 at the Steelers.\n",

    "analysis": "In Shane Waldron's play-calling debut as Seattle's OC, the team came out firing with three touchdowns on four first-half possessions, two being 23- and (nice) 69-yard scores over the top to Tyler Lockett (4/100/2). Its\u00a0offense emphasized rhythm more so than outright pass/run splits, leading to a median 54.7% pass play rate but, overall, 7.8 yards per play and 11 yards per attempt through the air; being across from Indianapolis' defense short Xavier Rhodes also helped. Fantasy managers who took a chance on Wilson after the top-five options in drafts should continue reaping the rewards of the team's new-look O\u00a0against the Titans in Week 2.\n",

Like Tannehill, Murray's protection was far from spotless, but unlike Tannehill, Murray kept Houdini-ing out of trouble for big plays with his legs and bigger throws. His passing scores went for five, 17, 26 and 11 yards, with the first two finding DeAndre Hopkins and the second two ending up in the hands of forgotten fourth-year pro Christian Kirk. Murray's INT was one of his only poor decisions. Murray had plenty of time in the pocket before simply forcing a ball to\u00a0Demetrius Harris. Murray now heads home for his Week 2 home debut against the Vikings.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Making his first start following last year's catastrophic leg break and this summer's shoulder woes, Prescott tied his career high for attempts in a seesaw affair where the Cowboys never attempted to establish the run vs. the Bucs' dominant front. Prescott's arm strength was noticeably limited compared to his career norm, but it didn't matter as he displayed elite ball placement and near perfect accuracy as he found Amari Cooper for 13 receptions and CeeDee Lamb for seven. He looked like Peyton Manning in his post-arm strength prime, simply putting the ball wherever he wanted against an elite defense, albeit one that lost its slot corner early in the game. Presumably, Prescott's arm will also get stronger as the year wears on. 10 days rest ahead of Week 2 could not be better timed as Prescott prepares to face the Chargers. With the Cowboys' defense looking almost as bad as last year's version this evening, the attempts will continue to roll right in for Prescott.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Herbert sliced and diced the vaunted Washington defense with ease throughout. The second-year quarterback was clutch on third downs, completing 13 of 16 passes for 160 yards and converting 11 first downs. He continually threw receivers open and faced little pressure from the Football Team's front seven. Herbert's day would have been far better if not for a controversial fumble near the end zone and an end zone drop by Mike Williams. Herbert picked up where he left off in his historic rookie campaign. He'll be a locked-in top-5 QB next week against the Cowboys.\u00a0\n",

With plenty of doubt surrounding his return from a torn ACL and MCL, Burrow looked as good as he did last year versus the Vikings. Like last year, Cincinnati's horrid offensive line betrayed Burrow at times, resulting in him taking five sacks. Alongside the sacks came Burrow's willingness to hang in the pocket and take shots.\u00a0His highlight of the day came on a 50-yard dime to Ja'Marr Chase that resulted in a walk-in touchdown. After taking a hit in the fourth quarter, Burrow got up gingerly and spent a few minutes on a bike between drives. He didn't miss any time but his mobility will be something to monitor in the Bengals' Week 2 matchup with the Bears.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Wentz surprisingly appeared healthy, consistently evading\u00a0pass rushers and even scrambling four times for 23 yards. It's worth noting he\u00a0also targeted Indianapolis' backfield on 15-of-38 (39%) said attempts. The issue is that his nine lives were all eventually used, taking 14 hits and four sacks over 60 minutes of action. He\u00a0still fortunately saved his box score in garbage time, finding Zach Pascal (4/43/2) with 4:43 remaining in the fourth quarter. Given the team's woeful pass-pro in Week 1, the Rams' front-seven should remove Wentz from any QB2 considerations in Week 2.\n",

Part of Minnesota's slow start can be attributed to their horrific penalty problems. The team was charged with 10 penalties in the first half while only counting accepted penalties. Minnesota's lackluster defense should force their offense to play with some tempo throughout the year, keeping Cousins in the middle of the QB2 range. He faces the Cardinals in another game that should feature plenty of points next week.\n",

Costly mistakes allowed\u00a0the Chiefs back in from that point forward, seeing Nick Chubb fumble\u00a0with 5:56 left in the third quarter and, worst of all, P Jamie Gillian scramble for a bobbled snap\u00a0to give Kansas City the ball back on Cleveland's 15-yard line. Travis Kelce's go-ahead eight-yard touchdown sealed the deal on that possession as Mayfield tossed a game-clinching turnover on the team's final drive. Managers should expect a much more efficient effort from Mayfield as a low-end QB2 in next week's matchup against Houston.\n",

Many in the fantasy community underestimated the Steelers' defense ahead of this one, keying on their shaky cornerback group, but the pass rush absolutely tormented the Buffalo offensive line and forced Allen into plenty of hurried throws. They also went for it on fourth down a few times only to be stopped. Allen's lone touchdown was a three-yard touchdown. Allen targeted Stefon Diggs and Cole Beasley 27 times in this one, but it produced just 129 scoreless yards. Allen will look to rebound next week at Miami.\n",

Christian McCaffrey was Darnold's\u00a0favorite target, as\u00a0the running back did his best slot receiver impression in addition to carrying the load as a rusher.

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Crazy Legs Jones was the story of the evening for the G-Men, but it still wasn't enough in yet another devastating defeat for an accursed organization. Jones appeared to have a 58-yard rushing touchdown in the second quarter on a read option keeper, but a ticky tack holding penalty turned it into merely a 46-yard gain. The Giants then, unsurprisingly, settled for a field goal. For the rushing score he did convert, Jones cashed in a quarterback draw. As a passer, Jones was under siege in the first half before finding more time after the break. He nearly turned it into a 43-yard touchdown strike to Darius Slayton, but the receiver could not corral a ball thrown inches too far. It will be labeled a drop, but it should have been a better pass. The touchdown Jones did convert was a 33-yard strike to Slayton in the third frame, where the wideout simply ran by William Jackson III. Elsewhere, Jones' timing looked off with Kenny Golladay, and the high-dollar free agent addition was spotted yelling at Jones on the sideline. He had a point. Jones has 10 days to lick his wounds before a golden matchup in the Falcons. Up to 122 yards rushing through two starts, Jones is punching way above his weight as a fantasy option. It will be hard to keep him out of the QB1 streamer mix for Week 3.\u00a0\n",

His touchdown was a nicely-thrown ball to Deebo Samuel down the right side that Samuel took 79 yards to the house. Averaging a monstrous 12.6 yards per attempt should quiet the Lance crowd for at least a week ahead of a Week 2 date with the Eagles.

The swarming Saints defense made life miserable for Rodgers and the Packers offense, which didn't convert a single third down in the game's first three quarters. Regression looked ugly for the Packers in Week 1. It might look less ugly next week against a Detroit defense that was ripped by the 49ers on Sunday.\u00a0\n",

What BB did not want to see was Jones' fifth play from scrimmage, where he panicked trying to spin out of a sack\u00a0and turfed the ball for a fumble. The Patriots managed to recover for a nine-yard loss. Thankfully, that moment was the exception and not the rule for a 23-year-old who looked plenty poised making the jump from the SEC West to AFC East. Jones gets an easier test in Week 2 against the Jets, though Gang Green's defensive line is not to be trifled with. With his weapons still sorting themselves out, Jones is a low-ceiling superflex option.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Making his second career regular season start,\u00a0Heinicke got over some early nerves \u2014 his first two drives went nowhere, with the Football Team's wideouts having to leave their feet on nearly every pass attempt \u2014 to settle in and do what the coaching staff wanted him to do: Relentlessly target Terry McLaurin and J.D. McKissic. Fantasy managers might disagree on the latter point, but McKissic provided the biggest play of the game with a 56-yard sideline reception in the fourth quarter, while McLaurin came up with one monster grab after another following the break.\u00a0Heinicke's ball placement isn't the greatest the NFL has ever seen, but it was better than replacement-level this evening, just as it was in the Wild Card Round. He did nearly throw the game away with a horrific fourth quarter pick on a pass that should have never left his hands. Either way, it's possible Heinicke is the best quarterback on the Football Team's roster. They will have more than a month to find out with Ryan Fitzpatrick out 6-8 weeks with a hip injury. There are going to be valleys for a journeyman like\u00a0Heinicke, but we have already gotten peaks that could not have been taken for granted. The Bills represent a stiff Week 3 road test, keeping\u00a0Heinicke merely in superflex territory.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "It was not an overly impressive day from the hyped second-year starter, but that was the expectation going in against an elite defense without Will Fuller. Tagovailoa's interception was the kind of decision he simply can't be making as a sophomore, however, as he was getting pounded for a sack and blindly heaved the ball near the sideline. It resulted in a critical fourth quarter turnover. Thankfully for Tagovailoa, the Patriots responded with an even-costlier giveaway. Tagovailoa took only two sacks, but he was running for his life behind the Dolphins' makeshift offensive line. That is certainly going to remain a concern going forward. With Fuller returning, Tagovailoa has another tough Week 2 test in the Bills before things soften up with the Raiders.\u00a0\n",

Tannehill's yards per attempt jumped by 2.8 when using play action last season, and he was Pro Football Focus' sixth best QB when using play action. Tannehill and the Tennessee offense were disastrous in Week 1 against a poor Arizona secondary, as Tannehill completed 21 of 35 attempts for 212 yards and a touchdown. He was sacked six times. Offensive coordinator Todd Downing might consider more play action calls this week against the Seahawks.\u00a0\n",

Perhaps of more worry is that Sanders didn't have a single red zone target or rush attempt -- though he did have plenty of carries in Atlanta territory. The workload concerns should leave him as a mid-range RB2 for next Sunday's tilt against the 49ers, but Sanders' speed and tackle-breaking ability came through in his performance today.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Whereas Gibson out-touched J.D. McKissic 23-1 in Week 1, McKissic came roaring back this evening, turning nine touches into 93 yards, 56 of which came on a critical fourth quarter reception. For his part, Gibson showed plenty of rushing juice against a tough defensive front, but he was never fully established in what became a surprising shootout. Fill-in QB Taylor Heinicke attempted a whopping 46 passes. For whatever reason, in these kinds of games, the Football Team has decided McKissic is their man. That was never more clear than Washington's two-minute drills, where McKissic scarcely came off the field. Gibson has the pass-catching pedigree to cut into that advantage, but it was wishful thinking to believe everything had changed after a Week 1 where McKissic still played 36 percent of the snaps. Gibson will be a high-end RB2 for a tough Week 3 date with the Bills.\u00a0\n",

Expect more of the same for Chubb moving forward. With a Charmin-soft matchup against the Texans on tap, Chubb is firmly a top-12 back for Week 2.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Montgomery was the best player on the Bears tonight, continuing his momentum from the end of last season in an impressive performance against a stingy defense. Damien Williams got his share of snaps \u2013 especially on passing downs \u2013 so it's fair to question whether Montgomery has the upside to repeat his RB6 (Weeks 1-16 only) performance from 2020, but the third-year back looks locked and loaded as a fantasy starter moving forward.\n",

New England's unpredictable backfield usage could mean Harris peaked int he season opener. Taylor should be picked up by RB-needy managers this week.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Conner was not targeted in the passing game. Conner out-carried Chase Edmonds 16-12, but eight of his handles came deep into garbage time in the fourth quarter of a game that was never competitive. Edmonds still narrowly won the snap battle and averaged two more yards per carry. Conner, of course, was taking the rock in highly-predictable running situations. This is indeed a 1A/1B backfield, but Week 1 mostly unfolded as expected, with Edmonds looking like the 1A. The duo gets the Vikings for Week 2. We would only trust Edmonds in the FLEX.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Sermon was made a healthy scratch in Week 1 but the loss of Raheem Mostert is forcing them to bring another back to game day. 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan indicated that Sermon's absence in Week 1 was simply because they chose to take three running backs to their opener and he didn't make the cut. The indictment of Sermon could mean that he'll be nothing more than a backup to Elijah Mitchell and even JaMycal Hasty in Week 2. Fantasy managers should wait to see what Sermon's role will be before considering him for their lineups.\u00a0\n",

It was a debut to forget for the No. 24 overall pick, who found zero running room behind Pittsburgh's horrific offensive line against an upper-echelon defense. Harris also needs to realize he's not going to run through defenders like he did in college. It's going to be a trying year for Harris behind this offensive line, but the touches are going to keep him on the RB1/2 map every week. Things should be easier next week at home against the Raiders.\n",

Then, on the second series, Davis lost a yard on a first-and-goal run\u00a0called back by penalty and had a third-down pass sail over his head. That was as close as Atlanta was able to get to a touchdown. Davis will\u00a0remain on the volume-based RB2/RB3 radar at Tampa next week.\u00a0\n",

Gainwell absorbs all of Scott's value and figures in to the RB3/FLEX picture in good matchups going forward. Next week against San Francisco probably isn't one of them just yet, though Gainwell was pretty impressive.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

There is still no reason to overreact to a poor performance against maybe the toughest run defense Elliott will see all season.

Bernard is a strict third-down option, a role he didn't quite appear ready for in Week 1 as he was in the final throes of his rehab from an ankle issue. Arians christened Jones his Week 2 \"starter\" earlier this week, but even before today's pronouncement, we knew that didn't mean much. Jones and Fournette both created Week 1 turnovers. Fournette's game is slightly steadier, but Jones is the only Bucs back with any semblance of big-play ability. We suppose that makes him our \"preferred\" Bucs backfield FLEX option.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "So this is how it's going to be, Bruce. Not that this is anything new for the Bucs' backfield. The only difference from 2020 is that passing-down back Bernard is in the mix. Bernard is a strict third-down option, a role he didn't quite appear ready for in Week 1 as he was in the final throes of his rehab from an ankle issue. Arians christened Jones his Week 2 \"starter\" earlier this week, but even before today's pronouncement, we knew that didn't mean much. Jones and Fournette both created Week 1 turnovers. Fournette's game is slightly steadier, but Jones is the only Bucs back with any semblance of big-play ability. We suppose that makes him our \"preferred\" Bucs backfield FLEX option.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "White's six grabs tied Jakobi Meyers for the team lead, while his seven targets tied Nelson Agholor for second. Mac Jones confirmed summer observations that he seemed primed to lock onto White as a safety valve like Tom Brady before him. White's ceiling was never the highest to begin with, and isn't going to rebound to its Brady levels, but he could offer a more stable PPR floor than 2020 with the Pats primed to pass more post-Cam Newton. He gets the Jets in Week 2.\u00a0\n",

Cooper's 13-of-16 target conversion was compared to 7-of-15 for CeeDee Lamb, though the prodigiously-talented sophomore also stacked up 7/104/1. Cooper's first score was a five-yarder where Prescott found him with some cushion at the front end of the end zone. The second was a 21-yarder in the third quarter where Coop took Ross Cockrell to school, humiliating him near the goal line. Tonight was essentially a shot-for-shot remake of the Cowboys' 2020, with the defense failing to enter the same area code as Tom Brady and Prescott needing to pile up attempts on offense. We would have to imagine things unfold much the same way in Week 2 against the Chargers, putting Cooper firmly in the WR1 mix.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Davis was the Jets' clear No. 1 wide receiver in Week 1, and with the running game struggling, the engine of the entire offense. His first touchdown came on a scramble drill, his second was an endzone target from the eight yard line. Davis' fantasy managers need to hope that Zach Wilson won't be under constant pressure, as he was in Week 1, going forward. Otherwise, Davis looks set up as a solid WR2 option in\u00a0Week 2 against the Patriots.\u00a0\n",

Fill-in starter Taylor Heinicke decided on a McLaurin-or-bust strategy after a quiet first quarter and McLaurin responded with one critical chain-moving grab after another. He is far and away the most important weapon in this passing attack, and Heinicke was able to make that critical determination on only three days' rest coming out of his Week 1 relief appearance. The duo should continue to hook up for a targets bonanza, stabilizing McLaurin's WR1 value. He does face a stiff Week 3 test in Tre'Davious White and the Bills.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Golladay could have had a bigger night, but a would-be 22-yard touchdown was wiped out by a blatant William Jackson III DPI. He also had a borderline \"drop\" that was really an inaccurate Daniel Jones throw. Jones had a laughable deep overthrow in the first half. It was Jones whom Golladay did not seem terribly pleased with, as FOX's cameras found him exchanging words with his quarterback on the sideline. The duo has combined for just 7/102 through two games, not what either side thought they were getting for $72 million. Golladay has a Week 3 get-right spot in the pathetic Falcons, but it is unclear if Jones' skill-set will meld with his in any matchup. Jones is going to have trouble finding you unless it is over the middle of the field or you are wide open outside. Golladay is a sideline tactician who does not create huge cushions. Stay tuned.\u00a0\n",

Mac Jones targeted seven different pass catchers at least three times, so this is going to be a crowded group, but Agholor could offer some big-play juice as a low-end WR4.

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Johnson was targeted on 10 of Big Ben's 32 pass attempts, good for a robust 31.25% share to lead the team. He also caught the offense's lone touchdown with a five-yarder early in the fourth quarter to give the Steelers a 13-10 lead they would never relinquish. Johnson picked up right where he left off last season as Big Ben's top target and will get an easier Week 2 draw against the Raiders as a volume-based WR2.\n",

    "analysis": "Jefferson was the recipient of a few errant passes from Kirk Cousins so his low catch rate isn't entirely his fault. Nine targes is a good start to the season but that only accounted for 18 percent of Minnesota's passes on the day. Adam Thielen led the team with 10 targets while KJ Osborn tied Jefferson's total. Thielen also operated as the\u00a0primary end zone receiver once again, notching a red zone score alongside a touchdown from 24 yards out. Fantasy drafters looking for Jefferson to cement himself as the WR1 for the Vikings may be disappointed but he remains a top-12 option at receiver. A high-scoring matchup with the Cardinals next week should give Jefferson a better shot at finding paydirt.\n",

    "analysis": "Kirk is now 33 percent of the way to his 2020 touchdown total after notching 26- and 11-yard scores, both coming in the second half as the Cardinals put the finishing touches on a road beatdown. The 26-yarder was a thing of beauty, as a pressured Kyler Murray simply lofted the ball off his back foot and Kirk managed to track it over his shoulder. For the 11-yard strike, Kirk beat S Kevin Byard 1-on-1 in the end zone. Free agent addition A.J. Green looked no less finished this afternoon than he did for the Bengals last season, so there could still be targets for Kirk's taking even if rookie Rondale Moore impresses, which he did on Sunday. Kirk will be in the WR48-55 range for Week 2 against the Vikings.\u00a0\n",

Dak Prescott's lone interception went off Lamb's fingers in tight coverage, while he also committed a few drops. His score was sensational, as he took advantage of a fake screen to run right by Bucs slot CB Sean Murphy-Bunting. Lamb was far less efficient than Amari Cooper, who hauled in 13-of-16 targets. He still offered more big-play juice, and drew almost as many looks. Attempts are not going to be in short supply in this offense, as the Cowboys' defense seems scarcely improved on last year's sorry unit. In fairness, it did have to deal with Tom Brady this evening. Both Lamb and Cooper will be in the WR1 mix for next week's date with the Chargers.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Edwards didn't catch his first pass until there was less than a minute to play in the fourth quarter, but the summer puff-piece All-Pro made some big plays late to help get the Raiders the win. He caught a couple balls to get Daniel Carlson in field goal range at the end of regulation and also reeled in a 32-yarder in overtime. Edwards needs to string some games together before we consider him a fantasy option. The Raiders go to Pittsburgh in Week 2.\n",

This output was more of an indictment of the Atlanta offensive line than anything Ridley did or could have done -- it was such tough sledding for Matt Ryan that he didn't attempt a single pass deeper than 20 yards down the field. That line could continue to be a problem for Ridley as the Bucs head into Week 2's game against Tampa's vicious pass rush, and it probably puts Ridley closer to the WR1/2 borderline than a sure-fire must-start.\u00a0\n",

With Jameis Winston throwing a mere 20 passes for 148 yards, Callaway had little chance of producing without a long touchdown. Game script went sideways in a hurry for both the Saints and Packers this week; that will make it tough to draw conclusions about pass catcher usage. Callaway should be an OK flex option in 12-team leagues next week against the Panthers.\u00a0\n",

Shepard continuing to lead the Giants in targets nevertheless makes too much sense. He is the perfect conservative option for a conservative quarterback taking plays from a conservative offensive coordinator working for a conservative coach employed by a conservative general manager cashing checks from a conservative owner. Shepard will have WR2 juice for Week 3 against the horrid Falcons.\u00a0\n",

However, he appeared to spend the entirety of overtime on the sidelines despite reemerging from the locker room. The Bengals listed him as probable to return and it was only a dehydration issue so it's safe to assume this won't come up again. Higgins finished two targets behind Ja'Marr Chase but was also featured in the red zone. He saw more targets than Tyler Boyd, who may be the odd man out in Cincinnati if the Bengals don't take their passing volume up a notch. As his ADP predicted, Higgins can be relied upon as a low-end WR2 going forward.\n",

The explosive rookie is behind only McLaurin in the team's wideout pecking order. The production will come, perhaps next week against the Bills.\u00a0\n",

It was not an easy ball to track, but it was the sort of reception he usually makes. Nevertheless, both Godwin's grabs and targets led the team, though Antonio Brown took the yardage crown with 121, while Rob Gronkowski found the end zone twice. For Godwin's five-yard score in the first quarter, he went in motion before the snap and easily freed himself over the middle of the field.\u00a0AB and Mike Evans' presence will make for some inconsistency, but Godwin is simply too good of a fit with Tom Brady's skill-set to fall out of the top 18 in fantasy. The Falcons' pathetic defense is on deck for Week 2.\u00a0\n",

The Jets looked desperate for pass-catching help in Week 1 as Braxton Berrios saw seven targets and the team amassed just 14 points. Crowder should take over for Berrios as New York's primary slot receiver and provide a considerable boost in play-making ability to the offense. He's a risky FLEX play until we see what the nature of his role will be.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "It wasn't all bad news for Watkins, who should benefit from some extra snaps in the absence of JJ Arcega-Whiteside. Watkins was a major focus for the Eagles early, catching three consecutive passes to start the game for Jalen Hurts. His deep skills make him more of a touchdown-or-bust flier until we start seeing some more involved target scripts for him, but Watkins isn't far off the radar and you could argue that he's shown enough to overtake Jalen Reagor eventually. He'll remain a deeper league-only option for Week 2's tilt against the 49ers.\u00a0\n",

His status for Week 3 remains unclear. Beckham's absence will continue to open up opportunity for Donovan Peoples-Jones, who ran a route on 84% of Cleveland's dropbacks in Week 1. It will also provide Anthony Schwartz another opportunity. The\u00a0rookie only played on 55% of dropbacks but saw a 19% target share to Peoples-Jones' 4%. Both players are dart throw options against a Texans team that might be just feisty enough to keep the Browns from running the entire game.\n",

The Seattle Times' Bob Condotta noted that Hart made a handful of impressive catches in minicamp including a one-handed snag on a touchdown pass from Russell Wilson. Hart has a slim but realistic path to becoming the third receiver in Seattle. He's a player worth monitoring once training camp gets underway.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "The Bengals took a ground-heavy approach in this game, tallying 36 runs to just 27 passes. With Tee Higgins and Ja'Marr Chase both demanding a floor of targets based on their talent alone, Boyd appeared to be the odd man out. His four targets were tied for third on the team and Higgins even missed some time while getting an IV. When the Bengals are playing from behind and forced to throw more, Boyd should have no problem racking up receptions and fantasy points. If they play half of the game with a lead like they did today, Boyd could struggle to be anything more than a deep FLEX option. His role in the Bengals Week 2 matchup with the Bears will be a good barometer for the volume he expects to see going forward.\u00a0\n",

It could have been our imagination, but Gronk seemed to have a little more life in his legs than he did in 2020. Playing in one of the most loaded offenses\u00a0of all time, Gronk will never again approach his Patriots ceiling and consistency, but it is possible he gets in the TE1 mix.\u00a0\n",

No other player saw more than three. In such a run-dominant offense, volume is going to be a struggle some weeks for Kittle. But he's still a weekly top-four play at the tight end spot ahead of a Week 2 date with the Eagles.\n",

The Athletic's Jay Morrison said Joe Burrow \"established an immediate connection\" with Uzomah in 2020, as the tight end saw five targets in Week 1 and six looks in Week 2 before going down with a season-ending Achilles injury in the first half. Drew Sample started the rest of the season for Cincinnati and ran the 12th most tight end routes on his way to a miserable 4.9 PPR points per game. Uzomah, 28, has been fully cleared and is expected to be a full go for training camp. He should be a popular late-round target in the Bengals' pass-heavy offense.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Granson is a fourth-round rookie, and as such he in unlikely to have a major role in the offense. Holder notes however, that\u00a0Jack Doyle and Mo Alie-Cox may have \"significant blocking responsibilities--especially with left tackle Eric Fisher on the mend from an Achilles injury.\" He also notes that the rookie has already been heavily involved in training camp.\u00a0Granson's potential role in the offense has been compared to Trey Burton's 2020 role, which came with a 34% snap share. The continued drumbeat on Granson makes him a very intriguing dynasty target. In 2021\u00a0though, Colts split\u00a0snaps and blocking commitments\u00a0will likely limit all three tight ends to bye week fill-in options and cheap DFS punt plays.\n",

He has a career 9.2\u00a0yards per target average and quietly had 438 receiving yards as a part-timer with the Cardinals last year. Only 26 years old, Arnold has some deep-league sleeper appeal as the Panthers' top receiving option at the position. Ian Thomas, who only had 145 yards as the Panthers' tight end last year, will likely head into a backup role.\n",

    "headlineNews": "David Njoku caught 3-of-5 targets for 76 yards in Cleveland's Week 1 loss to the Chiefs.\n",
    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Whether he was always part of the game plan or strictly involved in place of Odell Beckham (knee, out), Njoku's team-high in receiving yards were also a career-high\u00a0mark. He was used downfield often, averaging 25.3 yards per catch ahead of both Austin Hooper (3/27) and Harrison Bryant (1/17). Whether this usage was a one-off game plan or the blueprint for 2021 needs to be resolved before waiver wires run Tuesday night. We should know more when coach Kevin Stefanski speaks Monday.\n",

In the Ravens offense -- which used two tight end sets more than almost any other NFL team -- a No. 2 tight end can hold some fantasy value. Though Mark Andrews will function as the team's primary pass-catching tight end, Boyle will get lots of snaps and see some red zone usage. TE Josh Oliver has impressed in the preseason -- he had seven catches for 50 yards against Carolina last week -- could have a role if Boyle is sidelined to start the season.\u00a0\n",

Bass, who made a meager 20 of 28 field goal tries last year at Georgia Southern, would make a decent fantasy option in Week 1. Buffalo is a 6.5-point home favorite against the Jets.\u00a0\n",

McPherson is the favorite in the team's kicker competition with veteran Austin Seibert, who has also impressed coaches and beat writers this month. The Bengals offense is among the league's most kicker friendly. Last season, Randy Bullock was fantasy's third highest scoring kicker when Joe Burrow went down with a season-ending knee injury. Fantasy managers should consider McPherson if the game's top kickers are off the draft board.\u00a0\n",

    "headlineNews": "Dolphins signed kicker Jason Sanders to a five-year contract extension worth $22 million.\u00a0\n",
    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Fantasy football's No. 2 kicker in 2020 is cashing in on a profoundly efficient season in which he made 36 of 39 field goal attempts, banging through all 36 of his extra point tries. He established himself as one of the league's big-footed kickers by nailing eight of nine kickers over 50 yards. Sanders' extension includes a $10 million guarantee. His 2020 numbers stand in stark contrast to his 2019 stats, which include seven missed field goals on 30 attempts. Only the Cowboys and Falcons attempted more field goals than Miami in 2020, giving Sanders the opportunity necessary to become a waiver wire darling in fantasy. Sanders will probably be one of the most over-drafted kickers in fantasy football next season.\u00a0\n",

There was some buzz in the first week of August that Blankenship's job was in real danger a year after he logged the fifth most field goals in the NFL. The Colts attempted the fourth most field goals in 2020 -- a key factor in Blankenship's fantasy usefulness. There's no reason to reach for Hot Rod in 2021 drafts, though you could do worse than the second-year kicker in the final round of redraft leagues.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "As Over The Cap pointed out on Twitter, 29-year-old Santos has been cut five times since 2018. To say it's an aggressive move would be putting it mildly. The Bears were simply overjoyed by Santos' competent 2020 after years in the kicker wilderness. Santos converted 93.8 percent of his 2020 field goal tries, boosting his career mark to 83.1. Santos is not called on very often from 50-plus yards, making him an extra unlikely recipient of this kind of contract. There's a chance this deal could quickly become an albatross.\u00a0\n",

Lambo's lingering hip injury limited him to four games in 2020 and left the team scrambling for viable kicker options. Jacksonville's cast of kickers hit 18 of their 25 field goal attempts (72 percent), the third lowest rate in the NFL. They were the third worst in extra point conversions too. The most accurate kicker in Jags history, Lambo will have to outplay Rosas this summer if he's to keep his gig in 2021. Rosas -- the seventh highest scoring kicker in 2018 as a member of the Giants -- made eight of 11 attempts last year for Jacksonville. Whoever wins the team's kicker job will have some streaming appeal this season.\n",

Given how valuable the 25-year-old is to his franchise, expect Chubb to be brought along slowly in his first game back. Trevor Lawrence gets the honor of being the first quarterback to face the tandem of Chubb and Von Miller since Week 4 of the 2019 season.

When needed, Grant is plenty willing as a tackler and run fitter, though he is also still unrefined there. The Falcons lost starting safeties Ricardo Allen and Damontae Kazee this offseason, paving a path for Grant to potentially start in Week 1.\n",
