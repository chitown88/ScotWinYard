    "report": "",
    "analysis": "With the Chiefs winning 37-16, Mahomes took a seat for the final 6:50. Mahomes took three sacks behind his injury-compromised offensive line, so it was a no-brainer to get him out of the game. It was a nightmare day for Mahomes' fantasy managers, as the Chiefs housed a pick six and kick return touchdown, severely limiting Mahomes' volume and accumulation. When Mahomes\u00a0did have to throw, the Broncos did a good job of taking away the deep ball. Mahomes' score was a 10-yard quick out to Tyreek Hill where the wideout did most of the work. Mahomes hasn't had many of his typical eruptions this season, but today was the first time he failed to provide multiple scores. Mahomes has a mouthwatering Week 8 matchup in the Jets, though that will almost certainly be another game where he doesn't have to throw much in the second half.\u00a0\n",

It would not have been surprising for Kevin Stefanski to trot out Case Keenum and wave the white flag on Mayfield. He chose to give Mayfield more time and was rewarded with a historic performance from his young passer. Mayfield completed his next 21 passes and lead the Browns to a 37-34 win over Cincinnati. Mayfield has been dealing with a rib injury and was without Odell Beckham (knee) for most of this game. He was accurate at all levels after the shaky start and this performance should quell any rumors of him getting benched for now. The Browns face Oakland next week and Mayfield projects as a high-end QB2 in the matchup.\n",

    "analysis": "Outside of\u00a0one interception, Burrow did everything needed to come away from this game with a win. He was sacked four times while his offensive line dealt with a slew of injuries and still stayed in the pocket long enough to connect with Tee Higgins and A.J. Green on multiple deep passes. He also scored on the ground for the third time\u00a0this year. Cincinnati's defense simply couldn't stop Baker Mayfield once he got hot. Cincinnati ultimately lost 37-34. The Bengals continued to rely on Burrow's arm instead of opting for a balanced approach. Burrow is on pace for 670 throws in his rookie campaign. That mark would be eighth-most for an NFL passer, rookie or not. Burrow remains a fringe QB1 because of his passing volume and rushing production.\u00a0\n",

The Chargers' ceiling is higher than expected with Herbert pacing for Offensive Rookie of the Year consideration. He's leaped into the low-end QB1 conversation in fantasy circles, too.

    "headlineNews": "Derek Carr completed 24-of-36 passes for 284 yards, two touchdowns and one interception in Las Vegas' Week 7 loss to Tampa Bay.\n",
    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Carr went 3-for-3 for 62 yards and a touchdown on Las Vegas' opening drive but was quiet for the rest of the game as the Raiders'\u00a0defense (or lack thereof) failed to stop anything the Bucs threw their way, forcing Carr to dropback and get suffocated by\u00a0Tampa Bay's sieging front-seven. Carr\u00a0continued to show rapport with Nelson Agholor (5/107/1), finding the 27-year-old for a 44-yard gain in the third quarter, but was ineffective (and forced an interception) on 11 fourth-quarter plays while the Bucs closed the game on a 21-0 run. Fantasy players should consider this one a blip on the radar since Carr had previously tossed for 300-plus yards and multiple scores in back-to-back games. He'll rank as a low-end QB2 in Week 8 as the Raiders attempt to bounce back against Cleveland.\n",

Wentz has now posted three total scores in back-to-back games, finding the end zone with his legs each time out. Despite his impressive size, it can often feel like Wentz is taking his life into his hands with his reckless abandon running, but it's been a badly needed element for the Eagles and fantasy players alike. It is keeping drives alive and defenses on their toes. Tonight's\u00a0359 passing yards were a new season high by 89. Wentz once again targeted Travis Fulgham 10-plus times. The bad news is, DeSean Jackson got hurt just as a quickly as he returned and will almost certainly miss next week's showdown with the Cowboys. The statistics were good, but Wentz still missed too many easy throws this evening. Life won't be getting any easier behind the Eagles' injury-ravaged line, but his golden Week 8 matchup will have him in the low-end QB1 mix.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "It looked like it might finally be the day Bridgewater reached three passing touchdowns after he entered halftime 11-of-13 for 170 yards and a pair of scores. Instead, the Saints python'd the second half and Bridgewater was held under 260 yards for the second consecutive week. Bridgewater made a beautiful play on the Panthers' biggest strike of the day, looking S Marcus Williams away from the middle of the field to free D.J. Moore for an uncovered 74-yard score. TD No. 2 was a seven-yard flip \"pass\" to Moore. Bridgewater provides floor in most matchups, but the ceiling just isn't there. Nevertheless, that will be put to the test for this week's Thursday matchup with the Falcons. At worst, Bridgewater will be a top-16\u00a0option for Week 8.\u00a0\n",

The veteran\u00a0was not without his flaws, tossing a fourth-quarter interception into double coverage downfield even though the Colts led 28-27 at the time, but he did\u00a0lead the team's comeback\u00a0to that point with several splash plays to Marcus Johnson (5/108), a 17-yard score to Zach Pascal prior to the half, and a beautiful back shoulder toss to Jack Doyle for the go-ahead score. Although his weekly volume remains concerning, Week 8 offers another prime matchup against Detroit when the Colts return from their bye.\n",

Hamler and batted up into the air by the rookie. The bad throws are one thing. It's the lack of any good ones that is making Lock look nothing like the Broncos' quarterback of the future.

The reality is Foles has been very mediocre and was terrible in this one. He missed two would-be easy touchdowns when his receivers dusted Jalen Ramsey. One should've been a 96-yarder to Darnell Mooney, and then Javon Wims beat Ramsey for a would-be 66-yarder in the fourth quarter. Foles is merely a game manager who can't afford turnovers. The overrated 5-2 Bears host the Saints in Week 8.\n",

The G-Men would have been close to being able to run out the clock. Engram was also the culprit on Jones' interception, allowing the ball to clang off his hands.\u00a0Jones butchered his best play of the night, breaking free for a would-be 88-yard touchdown run on a read option in the third quarter only to face plant at the eight-yard line. Thankfully for the Giants, they were able to score four plays later. Jones now has three touchdowns over his past two games after going four weeks without a score, but he still isn't making enough plays for his moribund team.

    "analysis": "Fitzpatrick was caught off guard when he was called into coach Brian Flores' office to learn the news and admitted it \"broke his heart\" to find out he's not the starter anymore.\u00a0\"I basically got fired yesterday and my day today consisted of Zoom meetings listening to the guy who fired me, and being in a spaced out room listening to the guy who replaced me,\" Fitzpatrick said. He felt the Dolphins were his team right now, and he was playing well, leading the Dolphins to a 3-3 record headed into their bye week. Clearly, if this was Miami's plan all along, Fitzpatrick had no idea and was blindsided by it. There's been some chatter that the Dolphins could potentially listen to trade offers for Fitzpatrick ahead of the November 3 deadline. The NFL is always more fun when Fitzpatrick is playing.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "He caught 2-of-3 targets for 19 yards in the passing game. Gurley's first touchdown was a one-yard plunge, but his second was an accidental 10-yarder in the fourth quarter. With 1:12 left to play and the Falcons trailing 16-14 while in easy field-goal range, Gurley took a carry up in the middle and tried not to score but stopped himself too late and barely crossed the plane of the goal line with the ball while trying to fall at the one-yard line. It proved extremely costly, as the Lions came down and won the game on the final play. Still, Gurley's fantasy managers loved the outcome. Gurley now has seven rushing scores on the year. The efficiency hasn't really been there from a yards-per-carry standpoint, but Gurley is seeing plenty enough volume as a rock-solid RB2 in fantasy. He gets the Panthers in Week 8. Gurley put a 14-121-1 rushing line on Carolina in Week 5.\n",

A healthy Fournette lowers Jones' weekly floor, which seemed sturdy just a week ago. Fournette could be a flex option next week against the Giants.\u00a0\n",

They didn't really get them in a 43-16 win where the Chiefs scored defensive and special teams touchdowns and ran only 51 offensive plays. CEH won the touch battle 9-6, but he didn't put any daylight between himself and his veteran teammate. Neither back received a true goal-line carry, though CEH handled the rock from the 10 and 11, cashing the latter in for a score. Unfortunately for fantasy players, CEH dropped what should have been a second touchdown on one of three missed connections as a pass catcher. Now a Bell revenge game in the Jets is on tap for Week 8. CEH will maintain the RB2 rankings advantage, but his workload will be uncertain in another contest that could get out of hand fast.\u00a0\n",

More touches would have been nice, especially with Corey Clement handling the ball only three times, it's just so hard for the Eagles to get the ground game going behind their injury-destroyed offensive line. Miles Sanders' (knee) Week 8 status is unclear. If he can't get cleared to face the Cowboys, Scott will have some RB2 appeal vs. a truly terrible defense.\u00a0\n",

Clyde Edwards-Helaire out-touched Bell by a modest\u00a09-6 margin. The limited work is the limited work, but Bell's 6.5 yards per carry were 1.9 yards more than he managed in either of his 2020 appearances as a Jet. Neither Bell nor CEH handled a true goal-line carry, though both got a tote inside the 10. CEH's touchdown was an 11-yarder. The rookie also dropped another potential score. Rather amazingly, Bell now gets to face the Jets for Week 8. CEH will be the touch favorite, but Bell will be a viable FLEX in the #RevengeGame to end all revenge games for 2020.\u00a0\n",

Dillon 23 to 5. Aaron Rodgers found Williams on a crossing route for a 17-yard gain during the team's first possession and he\u00a0ultimately never looked back, punching in his first and only score on the afternoon to give Green Bay a commanding 35-20 lead in the final quarter. Jones will presumably return in Week 8 against the Vikings since he traveled with the team to Houston, but it's Williams who should clearly be rostered as a fringe RB1 if Jones isn't cleared in time.\n",

Not only did the 27-year-old dust Vernon Hargreaves on the goal line to give the Packers a quick 7-0 lead, he later burnt Eric Murray up the seam for a 45-yard touchdown immediately after the half. Adams' 47% target share was unsurprisingly\u00a0a season-high mark as he's now seen double-digit targets in all three games he's completed this year. There's still a chance Adams\u00a0finishes as fantasy's overall WR1. Expect another terrific outing in Week 8 against the Vikings.\n",

    "analysis": "Moore also seemed to be favoring his side late, but he was not announced with an injury. Bizarrely, the 93-yard effort was Moore's third straight. Two of those games featured only five targets, while Moore hasn't cleared five receptions since Week 2. Either way, he scored a 74-yard touchdown early in the second quarter when Teddy Bridgewater looked the safety away from the middle of the field, later following it up with a seven-yarder on a Bridgewater flip. Both Robby Anderson and Curtis Samuel saw more targets, but Moore's down-field involvement is keeping his WR2 floor and WR1 ceiling alive. He has a glorious short-week Thursday night matchup in the Falcons for Week 8.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

Hill's touchdown was a 10-yarder where he took a quick out and did most of the work. The Jets are a dream Week 8 matchup, but the danger, of course, is that the Chiefs' offense will get to pack things in far too early.

Beckham appeared to get a cleat caught in the turf as he chased down a defender after Baker Mayfield's first pass of the game was intercepted. He clutched his knee afterward, in obvious pain.

OBJ ends his 2020 season with 23 catches on 43 targets for 319 yards and three touchdowns. He had three carries for 72 yards and a touchdown too. Beckham, who will be 28 in November, is under contract with the Browns through the 2023 season. NFL Network's Mike Garafolo reports that\u00a0$12.971 million of OBJ's $15.75 million due in 2021 \"is guaranteed for injury and converts to a full guarantee if he\u2019s on the roster the third day of the league year.\" That nearly guarantees he'll be on the Browns' roster unless he's traded.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "To be honest, Claypool didn't even catch his target. It was a catch and fumble that ended with negative yardage. It was a disaster for the emerging rookie, outside of the confirmation that he is a starter over James Washington. Diontae Johnson (15 targets) and JuJu Smith-Schuster (13 targets) easily paced the team in targets with Ben Roethlisberger setting a new season high with 49 attempts. Claypool did get shadowed by the Titans' top corner, however. Claypool's ceiling is the highest given his athleticism, but rookies can be inconsistent, especially when playing on the outside. Expect Claypool to have many booms and busts as a WR3/flex play. It's worth tracking Diontae Johnson, who left Week 7 in the fourth quarter with a leg injury.\n",

The issue is that was the only time coach Jon Gruden attempted to use the lightning-quick rookie creatively, having him simply run go-routes for the second straight game. Ruggs has now recorded three targets in back-to-back starts since returning from injury, being out-targeted by Nelson Agholor 11 to 6 in that stint \u2014 completely unacceptable for an offense that clearly is in need of playmakers. Ruggs will remain a boom-or-bust WR3/4 in Week 8 against the Browns.\n",

Beckham appeared to get a cleat caught in the turf as he chased down a defender after Baker Mayfield's first pass of the game was intercepted. He clutched his knee afterward, in obvious pain. Beckham's absence will open up playing time for Rashard Higgins, who led the Browns in receiving against the Bengals.\u00a0Jarvis Landry could see a bump in targets with Beckham out. OBJ ends his 2020 season with 23 catches on 43 targets for 319 yards and three touchdowns. He had three carries for 72 yards and a touchdown too. Beckham, who will be 28 in November, is under contract with the Browns through the 2023 season. NFL Network's Mike Garafolo reports that\u00a0$12.971 million of OBJ's $15.75 million due in 2021 \"is guaranteed for injury and converts to a full guarantee if he\u2019s on the roster the third day of the league year.\" That nearly guarantees he'll be on the Browns' roster unless he's traded.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "With Michael Thomas (hamstring) and Emmanuel Sanders (COVID-19) sidelined, it was a supremely disappointing effort from the third-year pro, who was out-targeted by 2020 UDFA Marquez Callaway and 2019 UDFA Deonte Harris. The Saints just don't think very highly of Smith's game. Even if Thomas and Sanders remain sidelined for Week 8 against the Bears, Smith will be difficult to trust as a WR4 in a tough matchup.\u00a0\n",

With neither Thomas nor Sanders a guarantee to return for Week 8 against the Bears, Callaway would be a sensible waiver wire addition if his ankle checks out alright. Unfortunately, the Saints are one of the league's least transparent teams with injury information, so you may be flying blind when FAAB bids are due.\u00a0 \u00a0\n",

Head coach Joe Judge has spoken positively about Engram in recent interviews.\u00a0\"We're going to keep giving him the ball, keep making him the focal point of our offense, and we expect him to keep showing up,\" Judge said after Engram's back-breaking dropped pass against the Eagles in Week 7. It was the first time the Giants targeted Engram more than 20 yards down the field this season. It's unlikely the Giants will part with the tight end unless a team comes up with an offer they can't turn down.\n",

He's quietly seen 16 targets in three games since being activated from injured reserve, out-targeting Jack Doyle 16 to 6 in that span. Even if Mo Alie-Cox were to return in Week 8, it's clear the coaching staff prefers using Burton as the 1A option at tight end. Given his usage since returning, Burton will rank as a high-end TE2 with a confident floor when the team returns from its bye.\n",

Ebron\u2019s going to get a lot of targets and looks this year.\" There's\u00a0reason to believe Ebron will be deployed as the team's pass catching tight end, as Vance McDonald ran a pass route on a lowly 41 percent of his 2019 snaps.

Griffen was an August bargain for the Cowboys on the free agent market, but they are packing in their season following the loss of Dak Prescott. Ex-Viking Griffen has three sacks on 282 snaps this season. He will help goose the pass rush for a defense that has only eight quarterback takedowns across six games. For once, coach Matt Patricia is acquiring defensive talent instead of trading it away. 32-year-old Griffen will be a free agent again in the offseason.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Van Noy has two sacks and two tackles for loss through five games this year. His loss in the pass rush could give Joe Flacco extra time in the pocket to find Jamison Crowder or Breshad Perriman, who is expected to return from an ankle injury this week. Lawson was absent from the Dolphins' Week 5 contest with a shoulder injury. He notched at least one QB Hit in every game before that and has one sack on the year. Pressured or not, this news doesn't make Flacco worth anything other than a desperation start exclusively in 2QB/Superflex fantasy leagues.\n",
