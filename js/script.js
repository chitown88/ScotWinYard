He did his part by notching multiple rushing touchdowns in a game for the first time since Week 16 of the 2011 season, going in on a pair of one-yard sneaks in the third and fourth quarters. The future Hall of Famer did go without a touchdown pass for the second time in the last three games, but he's now generated four 300-yard efforts in his first six contests of the campaign. Brady will look to do his part to keep New England's record unblemished when he faces the Jets in Week 7.",

However, the third pick short-circuited New York's first drive of the second half at New England's 30-yard line, with Stephen Gilmore snagging a pass intended for Rhett Ellison.

The veteran remained free of any mistakes and battled through three sacks on the afternoon. Bridgewater also helmed an 11-play, 75-yard fourth-quarter march that knocked 6:22 off the clock and culminated in a four-yard touchdown pass to Jared Cook to seal the win for New Orleans. He also connected with six different pass catchers on the afternoon overall. Bridgewater will look to conquer the thorny challenge that is the Bears defense in a Week 7 matchup if he does indeed draw at least one more start in place of Drew Brees (thumb).",

While Jones would re-enter the game and produce decent results, it was Williams who wound up stealing the show, finishing with 14 rushes for 104 yards and four catches for 32 yards and the aforementioned touchdown. On the back of a disappointing display by his standards, Jones will aim for improvement in Week 7 versus the Raiders, but it wouldn't be surprising if the second-string Williams earns himself some extra touches following Monday's success.",

Still, it was a bit of a surprise to see the third-year back receive just four targets one week after recording a team-high 16 in a similar game script. It's clear the return of Gordon has essentially relegated Ekeler to his primary backup role, with the shifty running back attempting just eight carries over the last two weeks compared to 56 in Weeks 1-4. That hasn't meant a significant loss in playing time however, as the 24-year-old is still seeing close to 65 percent of the offensive snaps each week, but the lack of carries likely hinders the type of upside fantasy owners might have hoped for after such an impressive start to the season.",

It could prove difficult for Johnson to improve his efficiency in Week 7 against a Vikings defense that ranks eighth in the league with 3.8 rushing yards allowed per carry.

The third-year back is picking up where he left off following last season's breakout campaign, as he now has 470 rushing yards (4.7 YPC) and two scores through five games.

        "analysis": "Williams returned to the lineup after missing Week 5 with a concussion, and although Aaron Jones started as usual at tailback, Williams made his presence felt once offered the opportunity. Specifically, after Jones fumbled and dropped a would-be touchdown on consecutive drives, Williams was put in the game and quickly responded with a five-yard touchdown. He then ripped off a career-long, 45-yard rush on Green Bay's next series, ultimately helping him top 100 yards for the second time in his career. In comparison, Jones finished with 11 carries for 47 yards and four catches on seven targets for 13 more. Given that discrepancy, Williams could very well earn himself additional touches in Week 7 versus the Raiders, but considering Jones still ranks second league-wide with eight touchdowns and is usually rather reliable, Williams' extra work should still come in a second-string capacity.",

        "analysis": "With Chicago falling behind 17-0 at the half, they had to lean upon their passing attack to get back into the game. That led to Cohen seeing more snaps than David Montgomery while also being second on the team in targets. Although he caught all but one of his targets, he was unable to post a reception of longer than 12 yards. Although it didn't help most fantasy owners, his biggest play of the game was a long punt return that helped get the Bears back into the contest. This was the first time since Week 1 that he's been targeted more than twice in a game, and he's yet to see more than five carries in any contest, making him little more than a flex option in fantasy leagues.",

In addition to being a strong blocker, Freeman has caught at least four passes in four of his last five games and his receiving yards actually helped him edge Lindsay in total yardage Sunday.

        "analysis": "McCoy was the only Chiefs player to receive more than one carry as the team totaled just 11 rushing plays for the game. He averaged a respectable 5.5 yards per carry and looked especially spry on a 17-yard carry, but he simply didn't receive the type of volume necessary to generate big numbers. McCoy's involvement was minimal last week, and although he received double-digit touches in this one, he is difficult to endorse for fantasy purposes as more than a flex option in such a pass-happy offense. Still, he should be among the team leaders in backfield touches Thursday against the Broncos.",

        "analysis": "Sunday wasn't a banner day for Denver's offense, but Sutton came up twice in the clutch, first in the second quarter with a 41-yard reception down the sideline to move the Broncos from deep in their territory to within range for what was the team's second field goal of the day. He stepped up again during Denver's last full drive in the fourth quarter, converting a third down with an 18-yard catch over the middle to set up another Denver field goal. Sutton has been Denver's most dynamic target this season with at least 75 yards in four of six games and an impressive 15.9 yards per catch. Emmanuel Sanders left at halftime with a knee injury, and if he's out Thursday against Kansas City, Sutton will need to carry the load.",

He locked in a strong fantasy night early with a nifty 64-yard touchdown reception at the 6:05 mark of the second quarter, a play where Tate kept his concentration after initially bobbling the ball and raced down the right sideline into the end zone after securing it. The veteran pass-catcher displayed some solid chemistry with Jones, which was one of the few encouraging aspects of the Giants' three-touchdown loss. Tate will look to build on what was his first 100-yard tally since Week 4 of the 2018 season when he faces the Cardinals in Week 7.",

        "report": "Jones caught two of five targets for 17 yards during Monday's 23-22 loss to Green Bay.",
        "analysis": "Jones interestingly saw a lot of attention from stud cornerback Jaire Alexander in this one, presumably because the Packers wanted to match up the larger of their starting cornerbacks, Kevin King, on Detroit's 6-foot-4 Kenny Golladay. This translated into a tough outing for Jones and it didn't help that he seemingly was the victim of an uncalled pass interference penalty on a deep pass down the left sideline. Not only that, but there seemed to be other times when he got open only for Matthew Stafford to force a pass in to Golladay. Clearly nothing more than the second fiddle among Lions receivers, Jones isn't a safe bet for a rebound performance in Week 7 against a Vikings defense allowing the sixth-fewest yards per pass attempt (6.4) in 2019.",

Next up is a matchup against a Rams defense that held Jimmy Garoppolo and the 49ers to zero touchdown passes in its last game but, prior to that, gave up a combined 653 passing yards and eight touchdowns to the Buccaneers and Seahawks between Weeks 4 and 5.",

After that contribution, Rodgers looked for Lazard three times on the team's final drive, which ultimately helped set up the game-winning field goal. Although the injuries to his fellow wideouts will be important to monitor ahead of Week 7's game versus the Raiders, Lazard surely earned himself some extra snaps with his improbable performance Monday.",

If he couldn't make strides against Miami, it's hard to imagine a wildly improved result against the league's best pass defense, the 49ers, Sunday.",

Nelson (knee) and Dwayne Harris (ankle) sidelined, but the Clemson product managed to haul in just one pass in 42 offensive snaps. Trevor Davis led the WR corps in both playing time and production with 42 yards on four catches, but while backup tight end Foster Moreau also vultured a quartet of receptions for 46 yards of his own. As the Raiders' bye approaches, expect a healthier contingent of pass catchers the next time Oakland takes the field Week 7 against the Packers",

With the Steelers' defense hell-bent on stopping Keenan Allen, both Henry and Mike Williams received the largest target volume as the two combined for 19 targets, although most of that production occurred in the second half as the Chargers tried to erase a three-score deficit. While Henry isn't likely to benefit from that level of garbage-time production moving forward, the 6-foot-5 tight end clearly will be a major red-zone weapon moving forward.",

The 24-year-old tight end more than doubled his receiving yards on the year with the effort and will look to sustain a greater role in the offense Week 7 at Dallas.",

        "analysis": "Dissly suffered his second season-ending injury in as many years in the Week 6 win over the Browns. After Dissly exited the contest early, Willson played a season-high 56 offensive snaps and caught two of three targets for 16 yards. With a full week of starter's reps on tap, Willson could see his role expand a bit more versus Baltimore, though his prior production suggests he won't see nearly as much involvement as Dissly did. Willson's best statistical season came all the way back in 2014, when he caught 22 passes for 362 yards and three scores in 15 games with Seattle.",
