    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Coming off one of the finer performances of his already-storied career, Mahomes went from the Kliff Kingsbury easy chair to the Khalil Mack/Joey Bosa meat grinder. The result was a lot of pressure and a host of near interceptions, but ultimately no giveaways in a game the Chiefs eked out. Mahomes' closest call was a second quarter fling near the area of Marquez Valdes-Scantling that was easily picked but overturned via a dubious defensive holding call. There was a scary moment a little later where Bosa missiled into Mahomes' lower half. Somehow, a penalty was called on Mahomes' blocker instead of the pass rusher. Although it was not Mahomes' best night, it still featured two absolutely ridiculous plays on his touchdowns. The first was a nine-yard sidearm job to Jerick McKinnon. The second, a 41-yard seam strike to a streaking Justin Watson after Mahomes stepped up in the pocket. They were plays almost no one else is capable of making. Doing just fine with his revamped supporting cast, Mahomes has 10 days to rest up for a Week 3 road trip to Indianapolis.\u00a0\n",

Allen would later connect with Stefon Diggs on a four-yard touchdown to end the second quarter, and found his No. 1 receiver for two more scores in the third quarter, hitting him on touchdown scores from 14 and 46 yards out. With a 41-7 lead in place by the end of the third quarter, the Bills would mercifully pull Allen, ending what could have been a much bigger day.

Perhaps the most impressive drive of the game is one that came in the second quarter. On that drive, Goff and the Lions went 77-yards on nine plays and didn't face a third down, capping it with a three-yard touchdown to Josh Reynolds to go up 22-0 at halftime. As he did in Week 1, Goff looked to Amon-Ra St. Brown often. He and the second-year receiver connected on an 11-yard touchdown with the game on the line to secure a 36-21 lead, which would prove enough for the win despite a Washington touchdown on the ensuing possession. Goff has gotten off to a solid start for the 1-1 Lions and could be a QB2 next week against the Vikings.\n",

The second came from 26 yards away, and he essentially willed himself into the end zone, spinning through a couple defenders trying to strip him of the football. Hurts is now up to 28-147-3 as a rusher through two games. And on top of that, he tossed his first touchdown of the year with a 53-yard heave to Quez Watkins deep down the middle. Hurts was unstoppable in the Eagles' home opener and would have had a much bigger night in the box score if the Vikings were at all competitive. Hurts has the overall QB1 upside every time he takes the field and will get a road date with the Commanders in Week 3.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Primetime Cousins isn't a sight for sore eyes. He always seems to save his most embarrassing performances for the bright lights and island games. Cousins was blindly chucking dead ducks into the air and should have been picked off 6-7 times if Darius Slay, who got him twice, hadn't dropped multiple other opportunities. Slay lived on Justin Jefferson's hip all night, and Cousins kept forcing it. His lone touchdown was a two-yarder to Irv Smith. All three of Cousins' picks were in the red zone. After it looked like Cousins might be reborn under new coach Kevin O'Connell last week, he reverted to his normal self Monday. Cousins will look to rebound at home against the Lions in Week 3.\n",

We need to trust him and maybe give him more opportunities and stuff. We\u2019ve been pretty solidly conservative, counting on running the football.\u201d Seattle is actually seventh in pass rate over expected on first and ten this season -- a departure from their run-heavy ways during the Wilson era. Smith, for his part, has been serviceable under center, with a league-high 81 percent completion rate for two touchdowns and an interception. A commitment to the pass could make Tyler Lockett and DK Metcalf useful as WR2/3 options while Seahawks running backs would lose almost all their fantasy appeal. When asked what a more wide open Seahawks passing offense would focus on, Carroll said the team has to \"make sure the ball is going to DK down the field.\" Metcalf so far this season has been used as a short-area target, diminishing his fantasy prospects.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "It was a true tale of two halves for Wentz and the Commanders, who trailed 22-0 at halftime. It wasn't until their sixth drive that the Commanders notched their first, first down, with their first five drives ending in four punts and a safety. On their first drive of the third quarter, the Commanders fan pay dirt on a 15-yard touchdown pass to Curtis Samuel just moments after a 40-yard reception by Jahan Dotson. Wentz would toss an interception on the following drive but led another scoring drive on the following possession -- finding Logan Thomas for a 20-yard touchdown. Wentz would later connect with Jahan Dotson on a one-yard score late in the fourth quarter to draw within nine points, but that would be all for the now 1-1 Commanders. Wentz looked rattled at times in the first half but put together a solid second-half performance that was reminiscent of last week's win over the Jaguars. He's likely nothing more than a QB2 next week against the Eagles.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "It's the highest mark in the league, just head of Justin Fields and Baker Mayfield. New York's shoddy offensive line has made it nearly impossible for Jones to let downfield routes develop, resulting in a 6.3 average intended air yards per throw, the fifth lowest in the NFL through two weeks. His 6.9 adjusted yards per attempt is in line with his A/YA over his previous three NFL seasons. Jones after two weeks has PFF's fourth lowest passing grade among quarterbacks who have taken at least half of their team's snaps. With no protection and a penchant for checking down, the prospects of Jones suddenly become an aggressive downfield passer are nonexistent. Sterling Shepard and Richie James are likely to benefit from all the check downs, but neither have fantasy upside. Good luck to Jones and the Giants in Week 3 against destroyer of worlds Micah Parsons.\u00a0\n",

He compensated with 18 combined looks to Hunter Renfrow and Darren Waller, but they could not make enough big plays to offset Adams' invisibility as the Raiders slowly blew a 20-0 lead. It was Renfrow whose fumble six ended the game in overtime. There was nothing particularly objectionable about Carr's play, but he failed to make big strikes down the field. His long gain clocked in at 23 yards as he averaged 6.4 yards on his 39 attempts. At least through two games, Carr is not reaching new statistical heights in the Adams/Josh McDaniels era. The Titans could go either way as a Week 3 matchup.\u00a0\n",

Miami kept Tua clean in the pocket for much of the second half after struggling to protect him in the first half. And Tua delivered over and over again against a Baltimore coverage unit that stood no chance against Waddle and Hill. Waddle caught Tua's sixth touchdown to take the lead with under a minute to play. On the day, Waddle saw an absurd 19 targets. If Miami's offense remains unapologetically pass heavy, Hill and Waddle could be elite fantasy options every week. Tua has thrown 83 passes through two weeks in the team's new offense.\u00a0\n",

Then Murray and the passing attack came alive despite a string of never-ending miscues, including a James Conner injury, dropped touchdowns, a delay-of-game on a two-point conversion, etc. Murray and his pass catchers made just enough plays to get the contest to overtime, none bigger than Murray's game-tying rushing scoring with zeros on the clock. It wasn't officially game-tying until Murray threaded an impossible seed to A.J. Green on the two-pointer even after Green almost single-handedly gave the contest away with drops. They almost won it with a huge strike to Marquise Brown in overtime but put the game on the defense's shoulders. It answered with a fumble six. Murray and his offense have major problems, including a continued lack of coherent pass-game design and no real boundary threat. They also still have Murray, whose singular play-making presence rivals that of anyone in the league. The Rams loom for Week 3.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Tannehill's performance was about what you'd expect from a quarterback whose team lost 41-7. The Titans' signal-caller averaged just 5.9 yards per attempt on the afternoon and saw his lone touchdown go in the Bills' favor when he tossed a pick-six to linebacker Matt Milano. That interception would be Tannehill's last pass of the night before the veteran gave way to rookie quarterback Malik Willis late in the third quarter. The Titans' offense looked out of sync throughout most of this one, as they were simply unable to hang with the Bills' high-powered offense. Now off to an 0-2 start, the Titans will like to correct course next week against the Raiders. He's nothing more than a QB2 next week.\n",

Two of those quarterback takedowns came inside the Jags' 30 on the same fourth quarter drive. None of Ryan's turnovers were in the red zone, though two were inexcusable throws. The third was batted at the line of scrimmage. It's hard to grade Ryan too harshly considering his wideouts' absences, but it is the second week in a row he failed to make big plays or generate down-field production. He is moving slower than ever. Following a tie with the Texans and this horrid shutout loss, there doesn't seem to be much meat left on the bone. Ryan will pray Pittman is ready to return for next week's home date with the high-flying Chiefs. Ryan could be in for a punishing afternoon if the Chiefs get out to an early lead.\u00a0\n",

Things only got worse during the game with Mike Evans getting ejected and starting left tackle Josh Wells going down. Brady was visibly frustrated throughout the game, often directing his ire at his receivers. With the line issues having no end in sight, it may be a while before Tampa Bay figures things out with this setup. Brady may only be a high-end QB2 option versus the Packers next week.\n",

    "analysis": "Fields hit Equanimeous St. Brown for 30 yards on the game's opening drive, making up almost half of his total passing yardage. He took three sacks and didn't remotely fool the Packers on a few running plays. He also had two near-touchdowns on Chicago's penultimate drive of the game, coming up just short of the pylon on third down and appearing to get the ball over the goal line in an \"inconclusive enough to NFL refs to change the call\" sort of way on fourth down. Fields has 191 passing yards in two games. Maybe the Texans in Week 3 will change things to some extent -- the Packers and 49ers are tough defenses -- but he's a risky superflex start given how little the Bears seem to want to pass the ball.\u00a0\n",

The Broncos have now scored 32 points in two games, which we're told is bad for fantasy value.

Rush looks to be a fine caretaker of the Dallas offense for the next month or so, while Dak Prescott heals from post-Week 1 thumb surgery. Rush peppered CeeDee Lamb with targets in this one -- a potentially good sign for Dallas' No. 1 wideout.\u00a0\n",

No Packers receiver had more than four targets and Green Bay was able to sit on the ball after building a 24-7 halftime lead.

Lance was unable to return and a report from ESPN's Adam Schefter says he will miss the remainder of the season. Garoppolo tossed a 38-yard touchdown to backup tight end Ross Dwelley, though most of the yardage came after the catch. In the fourth quarter, Garoppolo snuck in a score at the goal line to ice the game. San Francisco played ultra-conservative in this game, though there was never a need for them to air the ball out. In a more competitive game, Garoppolo could be a viable streaming option. That should be the expectation for the 49ers' Week 3 matchup with Denver.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Chubb added three catches for 26 yards on three pass-game targets. He appeared to put the game away with a 12-yard touchdown run with 1:55 left, putting the Browns up 31-17, but Cleveland allowed a 66-yard score to Corey Davis, the Jets recovered the onside kick, and then won the game with a 15-yard score to Garrett Wilson. Chubb was the star on the Browns' side, scoring from four, seven, and 12 yards out. He's now totaled over 100 yards in back-to-back games to open the season in the Browns' run-heavy offense and is a locked-in RB1 every week with a date with the Steelers on deck.\n",

Mixon drafters shouldn't panic though; he's clearly the team's workhorse and should suffice as a low-end RB1 for as long as he's seeing a hefty portion of the carries and backfield targets. Mixon is a top-12 option in Week 3 against the Jets.\u00a0\n",

Montgomery managed four red zone carries despite the chaos around him, but couldn't get to pay dirt.

Gibson was once again the lead ball carrier, but he lost valuable receiving work to J.D. McKissic, who caught seven passes for 54 yards on seven targets. Facing a high-powered Eagles offense in Week 3, Gibson could be an iffy RB2 if McKissic sees most of the passing work in what may be a negative game script.\n",

Sanders again dominated the backfield work among the Eagles' RBs, out-carrying Boston Scott and Kenneth Gainwell 17-4-2. But it was Jalen Hurts (11-57-2) who scored both of Philly's rushing scores. Sanders is always going to be iffy in the touchdown department with Hurts keeping it a lot near the goal line, but Sanders remains a strong RB2 option in an elite rushing offense. He gets a Week 3 date with the Commanders.\n",

The few times Taylor did get the ball, he was looking powerful and angry. Taylor has now posted one mammoth effort and one dud through two shaky Ryan starts. Game script could become a problem in a hurry in next week's showdown with the Chiefs, but it is safe to assume getting Taylor the ball will be a bigger point of emphasis than it was on this dismal afternoon.\u00a0\n",

With the Jags then leading by two scores for the final 37:52 of their eventual 24-0 win, Robinson was getting brickwalled in predictable run situations. That still does not explain away just 27 yards on his 22 non-touchdown carries. Not a good afternoon, though Travis Etienne could manage all of 20 yards on his nine totes. Etienne added 3/23 through the air. Through two weeks, this has been a traditional committee with Robinson as its clear-cut chairman. He will be a high-floor, if low-upside, FLEX for Week 3 against the Chargers' tough defense.\u00a0\n",

Jacobs handled two carries from inside the Cardinals' six-yard line on the Raiders' opening but couldn't convert either for a score. He ended up getting \"vultured\" by Davante Adams and didn't come close to the goal line the rest of the afternoon. Jacobs' third-down involvement figures to remain frustrating going forward, but he has been unchallenged on early downs, keeping him in the low-end RB2 mix.

Everyone except coach Sean McVay. Akers out-carried Henderson 15-10 and saw all three backfield targets. Akers, however, turned his carries into a pitiful 2.9 YPC while Henderson averaged 4.7 YPC and found the end zone on the ground. Henderson deserves to be the 1A here, but McVay really wants Akers to be back to the 2020 version of himself. He just hasn't looked like it since the torn Achilles in 2021. Henderson is a risky RB2 for Week 3 against the Cardinals.\n",

    "analysis": "Though John Harbaugh called Dobbins \"week to week\" on Monday, a full practice on Wednesday is a good sign that he will be able to suit up for Week 3. Dobbins missed the first two weeks of the season while recovering from the torn ACL he suffered last summer. The injury wasn't just limited to his ACL, as Dobbins himself has said his\u00a0LCL, hamstring, and meniscus were all affected. Given the extent of the injury, it makes sense for the team to be extremely cautious with his return. Once in the lineup, Dobbins will project for RB2 fantasy numbers.\u00a0\n",

Elliott plodded for 3.5 yards per carry even as Tony Pollard broke a big play -- or threatened to break a big play -- seemingly every time he touched the ball. Pollard notched 7.6 yards per touch against Cincy. Through two games, Elliott has rushed for 105 yards on 25 carries and has -7 receiving yards. He managed to lose nine yards on a second down carry in the second quarter against the Bengals. No amount of wishcasting is going to budge Zeke from his spot as the team's unquestioned No. 1 back. He's a volume-based RB2/3 for Week 3 against the Giants.\u00a0\n",

With No. 3 RB Pierre Strong seeing just three snaps, both Harris and Stevenson look like RB2 options against the Ravens in Week 3.\n",

If Washington prioritizes McKissic in the passing game going forward, he could be a solid RB3 in games that include negative game scripts -- which could be as early as next week when the Commanders play host to the Eagles.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Not even a touchdown could salvage Henry's performance in this one, as the Bills held him and the Titans in check all evening. Averaging a dismal 1.9 YPC on the evening, Henry's longest run came on a nine-yard gain on the Titans' first drive of the game. The Titans trailed 17-7 at halftime, but Henry was all but phased out in the third quarter when the Bills exploded for 24 unanswered points to put the game out of reach. Through two games, Henry has rushed 34 times for 107 yards and one touchdown and is averaging just 3.1 YPC. You have no choice but to start him in Week 3 against the Raiders in hopes that a breakout game is on the horizon.\n",

He managed to tack on some YAC all the same. It helped mitigate some red zone frustration after CEH was out-touched 3-0 inside the 20 by Jerick McKinnon. That included a nine-yard passing score for McKinnon and two-yard carry from the Chargers' three. CEH did out-touch McKinnon 12-6 on the whole. Now box score productive in both a non-competitive blowout and grinding four-quarter affair, Edwards-Helaire is certainly off to a strong fantasy start after last year's disappointments. Even with McKinnon in the fold, Edwards-Helaire will have RB2 juice for Week 3 vs. the Colts.\u00a0\n",

McKinnon's touchdown was one of just two to come on offense for the Chiefs on Thursday. We doubt McKinnon will dominate the high-value touches every week, but we already knew the Chiefs trusted him in the most important areas of the field. That limits Edwards-Helaire's upside while giving McKinnon some last-gasp FLEX appeal in this two-man backfield.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

They combined for just 10 rushes for 25 yards rushing. Seattle signaled before the season that it favored Homer on passing downs, and that has come to fruition in the early weeks of the season. Homer is a weak RB2 dart throw option and keeps keeping Penny and Walker from being much more than that for the time being.\n",

He had been relegated to a distant RB2 in Week 1 against the Patriots, seeing five rushes for 16 yards. A wily veteran of Miami's Shanahanian rushing attack, Mostert looked the part of a primary back against the Ravens. He displayed impressive burst and made something out of nothing a few times in the first half. Chase Edmonds logged one more route than Mostert against the Ravens, but it was Mostert who saw three targets to Edmonds' two. Neither back will dominate touches barring injury. Mostert looks like an interesting flex option for Week 3 against the Bills.\u00a0\n",

Far from the No. 1 option in Washington's offense, Dotson has proven reliable when called upon, totaling three touchdowns on the first 10 targets of his career. Despite a nice start to his career, he's hard to trust as anything more than a deep flex with Terry McLaurin and Curtis Samuel also seeing significant work.\n",

    "analysis": "The Bills' WR1 saw some extra looks in this one with Gabe Davis (ankle) sidelined. Diggs and the Bills moved the chains throughout this one, but it was his nose for the end zone that stood out above all else. Diggs' first score of the day came on a four-yard pass from Josh Allen, but his biggest play came on a 46-yard score in which he burnt the Titans' secondary for the long score. His final score, which came from 14-yards out, came on an RPO in which he beat safety Chris Jackson for the score. Diggs and Allen are off to a hot start after the two connected for 8/122/1 in Week 1 against the Rams. That should continue in Week 3 against the 2-0 Dolphins.\n",

Frequently lined up with Byron Murphy, he managed just one more catch the entire afternoon, even with the benefit of overtime. It was a night-and-day difference from his 17-look Week 1. The Raiders have Hunter Renfrow and Darren Waller to make plays when Adams gets locked up, but it was the wrong kind of plays on Sunday, with Renfrow committing a game-losing fumble six in the extra period. These kinds of days are going to be rare for Adams, though perhaps a little more frequent than they were in Green Bay. Adams will remain a top-five WR1 for Week 3 vs. the Titans.\u00a0\n",

The New Orleans offense struggled in this game, but Thomas's role in the red zone always gives him an out to a solid fantasy day. His nine targets were also the second-most on the team. The Saints' passing game doesn't run strictly through Thomas like it used to, but he remains an integral part of the offense. Thomas will look to keep up his WR2 pace versus the Panthers next week.\n",

Both of Hill's long scores were underthrown by Tua\u00a0Tagovailoa, though it didn't matter after Hill had dusted everyone in the Baltimore secondary. Hill, who drew a target on 32.5 percent of his routes in Week 2, is as unstoppable as a deep threat as he was during his time in Kansas City. With the Dolphins committing to the pass, Hill and Waddle should be considered top-12 fantasy options in Week 3 against Buffalo.\u00a0\n",

His lack of target volume could become an issue at some point this season, but with big-play ability in a pass-first Baltimore offense, Bateman could prove efficient enough to be an every-week WR2.

    "analysis": "Wilson played 61% of snaps in Week 2, which was up considerably from 49% in Week 1. In terms of snaps, Wilson remained the clear No. 3 wide receiver behind Elijah Moore (86%) and Davis (77%). However, Wilson took more running plays off than passing plays, which cause the snaps to understate his role. Wilson ran a route on 75% of dropbacks, which matched Davis, and is a level at which he should be fantasy relevant moving forward. Of course, Wilson's 32% target share and 8-102-2 receiving line could easily lead to another role increase in Week 3. Wilson is shaping up as a solid FLEX option for Week 3 against the Bengals.\n",

    "analysis": "Kirk has gone from being the most overpaid receiver in the history of the NFL to posting 12/192/3 through his first two games in a Jaguars uniform. Today's two-score effort came even though the Jags were never pushed in a game they led by multiple scores from the 7:52 mark of the second quarter onward. He may have doubled his number of targets had the proceedings been closer. For touchdown No. 1, Kirk easily converted a 10-yard crosser in the middle of the field. For No. 2, he caught a flick from Trevor Lawrence on a play-fake rollout. Lawrence wasn't necessarily looking like a rock star vs. the Colts, but it was the second straight week where he at least appeared removed from the stink of Urban Meyer. That is excellent news for his well-paid No. 1 wideout. Kirk will face a stiff Week 3 test in the Chargers' play-maker filled defense.\u00a0\n",

Slay picked off Kirk Cousins twice on passes intended for Jefferson. Through two games, Jefferson has seen a total of 23 targets and remains in the overall WR1 mix week in and week out with a Week 3 date with the Lions on deck. Look for a big bounce-back effort from Jefferson against a much softer secondary.\n",

Tee Higgins led the team in targets, receptions, and receiving yardage, and caught Joe Burrow's lone touchdown on the day. Chase appeared to be held by Dallas defenders on at least two would-be receptions in the second half. Chase's deep shot opportunities have been limited largely because Burrow has no time to operate in the pocket behind what has remained one of the NFL's most porous offensive lines. Burrow has been sacked 11 times and was pressured on almost every second half drop back against the Cowboys. Chase is, as always, a WR1 option for Week 3 against the Jets.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "St. Brown once again led all Lions receivers on the day, seeing yet another 12-target day on the afternoon. He would score the first and last touchdowns for the Lions in the one, with his first score coming on a 13-yard touchdown in the first quarter. He would post two plays of 40+ yards in this one, which included a 58-yard run late in the third quarter just minutes after a Washington touchdown. St. Brown's final touchdown came on an 11-yard reception midway through the fourth quarter, which would end up being enough to put the game out of reach for Washington. St. Brown is a high-end WR2 next week against the Vikings.\n",

Campbell was a feel-good summer story because he finally stayed healthy, but he has only three grabs for 37 yards through two games, one in which he was the No. 1 receiver from a snaps/routes perspective. 12-team leaguers probably need to move on.\u00a0\n",

In terms of snaps, Wilson remained the clear No. 3 wide receiver behind Elijah Moore (86%) and Davis (77%). However, Wilson took more running plays off than passing plays, which cause the snaps to understate his role. Wilson ran a route on 75% of dropbacks, which matched Davis, and is a level at which he should be fantasy relevant moving forward. Of course, Wilson's 32% target share and 8-102-2 receiving line could easily lead to another role increase in Week 3. Wilson is shaping up as a solid FLEX option for Week 3 against the Bengals.\n",

Matthew Stafford responded by hitting Robinson for a one-yard score in the first quarter. The two later connected for another short score, but it was called back for a \"medical timeout.\" Robinson is still adjusting to his new digs, and Stafford remains locked on Cooper Kupp, who has posted back-to-back double-digit catches outings and found the end zone twice Sunday. Robinson is clearly the second or third fiddle behind Kupp and short-area favorite Tyler Higbee. Robinson will be a WR3 next week against the Cardinals.\n",

    "analysis": "Lamb now has 22 targets through two regular season games, but just 104 scoreless yards (11.5 yards per catch) to show for it. Cooper Rush targeted Lamb on a bulky 33.3 percent of his pass routes against the Bengals in what devolved into a conservative, run-heavy offense after a first quarter in which the Cowboys came out throwing aggressively against a middling Bengals defense. Lamb's target share should continue putting him in the WR2 conversation. Fantasy drafters who thought they were getting an alpha WR1 are going to need to come to grips with Lamb's limited upside in a misguided Cowboys offense with Rush at the helm. Lamb is certainly a top-24 option in Week 3 against the Giants.\u00a0\n",

Samuel would help setup another scoring drive with a 27-yard reception in the third quarter, and reeled off a 21-yard run early in the fourth quarter. Through two games, Samuel has totaled 171 yards and two touchdowns while seeing 26 opportunities. He'll be a high-end WR3 next week against Philadelphia.\n",

    "analysis": "In a down day for the Bengals offense, Higgins -- who missed some practice time this week after suffering a brain injury in Week 1 -- led all Bengals pass catchers in targets, receptions, and receiving yards. He caught Joe Burrow's only touchdown of the day while Burrow struggled to get in sync with Ja'Marr Chase. It's a reminder that Higgins would be an alpha WR1 on many NFL teams but regularly takes a backseat to the dominant Chase. More negative game script for the down-bad Bengals could generate a glut of targets for both Higgins and Chase this season. Higgins will be a solid WR2 option in Week 3 against the Jets.\u00a0\n",

The Cardinals were lucky to be in that position at all after Green dropped a touchdown in the end zone and muffed the ball at the one-yard line late in the fourth quarter. Earlier, he failed to get two feet in-bounds on what would have been a routine catch during his prime. He also committed another drop and erased a long Murray run with a holding penalty. It just wasn't a good performance, the latest in a long line of them for a wideout whose play-making ability is all but evaporated at age 34. The Rams are not a plus Week 3 matchup.\u00a0\n",

He went for 95 yards on nine catches while taking the field for 82 percent of New England's offensive snaps. Meyers has led the team in targets in both weeks. If he were to miss anytime, it would be a significant hit to New England's already-weak passing game.\n",

Thielen now has just seven catches for 86 scoreless yards through two weeks, playing a very distant second fiddle to Justin Jefferson. Thielen is looking like a low-floor, low-ceiling WR3/4 ahead of a Week 3 date with the Lions.\n",

    "analysis": "It was a career day for Waddle following a slow Week 1 for the second-year wideout. Waddle was clearly Miami's offensive focal point to start the game. The Dolphins used Tyreek Hill as something of a decoy -- sometimes in the backfield -- while Waddle continually found soft spots in the Baltimore secondary. He had a 59-yard reception in the first half and went on to catch the game-winning score with less than a minute remaining. Baltimore's injury-marred coverage unit had no answers for Waddle's quickness. Miami's commitment to the pass should make Waddle and Hill high-end fantasy options going forward.\u00a0\n",

It wasn't a massive showing from Lazard, but the Packers were able to rely on their ground game while the hapless Chicago offense sputtered about. He will likely have his practice reps capped until the ankle injury is far behind him. Trusted by Rodgers, Lazard will be a go-to option in the red zone, though his ability to command a large target share remains in doubt. He will be a WR3/4 if healthy for Week 3.\n",

The Ravens' receiver room is thin and Robinson should give them a higher floor, but don't expect much in the way of a ceiling from him. Robinson began his NFL career with the Chiefs in 2016. He failed to reach 500 yards in any of his six pro seasons. He will likely compete with Tylan Wallace for WR4 duties in Baltimore.\n",

He finally found Olave for a 51-yard gain, but the rookie secured the catch, stumbled to the ground, and fumbled the ball. It was recovered by a Tampa Bay defender. The good news is that his usage was elite and should give fantasy managers hope he can be a long-term FLEX option. Olave will look to capture some of those air yards in his Week 3 matchup with the Panthers.\u00a0\n",

Despite his lack of production in the opener, Hollins was running a route almost every play, and that is evidently something that is going to stick for the time being. Coach Josh McDaniels must like the 6-foot-4 wideout's field-stretching ability, and Sunday's results were admittedly decent. Be that as it may, there is zero reason to think Hollins will become a top-50 option at wideout as he scraps for targets behind Adams, Hunter Renfrow and Darren Waller.\u00a0\n",

Perhaps an injury or two could get him briefly on the fantasy radar at some point this year. Moore appears to have beaten out Phillip Dorsett for Houston's speed receiver role. He'll be yet another member of Houston's offense we can't recommend for Week 3's game against Chicago.\u00a0\n",

Before that, Palmer and Justin Herbert did not seem to be on the same page, miscommunicating twice. Palmer's score came as Herbert gutted through a rib injury. Herbert's health looms large for Week 3 vs. Jacksonville, but coach Brandon Staley indicated afterward he expected Herbert to play. The bigger question for Palmer is Allen, who is tentatively expected back following his one-game absence.\u00a0\n",

Gassed following a 26-yard screen rumble in the fourth quarter, Everett begged out of the game after he advanced to the Chiefs' three-yard line. Instead, the Chargers went hurry up and kept Everett on the field. Justin Herbert targeted him at the goal line, Everett could scarcely move toward the ball, and the attempt turned into a 99-yard pick six. Brutal, though it doesn't show up in Everett's 9/125/1 box score through two games in a Chargers uniform. He will operate as a high-end TE2 for Week 3 vs. the Jaguars.\u00a0\n",

Schultz caught two of four targets for 16 yards against the Bengals before his injury. He was targeted on a lowly 14.2 percent of his pass routes. Schultz drafters should explore the waiver wire this week.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Smith split snaps and pass routes with Johnny Mundt against the Packers. He caught neither of his two targets from Kirk Cousins. O'Connell said Smith will have big outings in 2022, if and when the game plan includes the tight end running more routes. This makes it nearly impossible to predict Smith's usage, making him a streaming option in 12-team leagues. Managers should feel free to cut Smith headed into Week 2.\u00a0\n",

Meanwhile, rookie WR1 Drake London went 8-86-1 against the Rams and has posted 13-160-1 on 19 targets as Marcus Mariota's top target. Pitts needs to be downgraded to mid-to-low TE1 range but remains an every-week starter on talent and upside alone. Pitts will try to get right against the lowly Seahawks in Week 3.\n",

Koo is now the league's second-highest paid kicker at $4.85 million per year, trailing only Justin Tucker at $5 million. Koo bounced around the league a bit with the Chargers and Patriots before settling in with the Falcons in 2019. He's been dynamite in Atlanta, drilling 92.6% of his field goals, going 87-of-94 in three years, and 95.1% of his extra points in that span. He's also 13-of-14 on field goals of 50-plus yards. Koo deserves the pay day.\n",

Tucker has certainly earned the highest-paid-kicker status after a decade of clutch kicking in Baltimore. The big-footed Tucker, who last year set the league record with a 66-yard bomb at the buzzer against the Lions in Week 3, has drilled 91.1 percent of his 358 field goal tries since entering the league in 2012. He's made a mind-boggling 72.8 percent of his kicks beyond 50 yards. Last year, he made all six of his attempts from outside 50 yards. Though the Ravens' red zone aggressiveness sometimes limits Tucker's opportunities, he should be the first kicker off draft boards in 2022.\u00a0\n",

    "headlineNews": "Bengals special teams coordinator Darrin Simmons said Evan McPherson staying on the field to watch the Super Bowl halftime show remains \"a real sore subject.\"\u00a0\n",
    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Apparently the team was less than thrilled with their all-world kicker not joining his teammates in the locker room during halftime of the Super Bowl. TV cameras showed McPherson, 22, staying on the Bengals benched taking in a show by legendary hip-hop artists. \"Though the stunt still isn\u2019t sitting well with Simmons, it eventually will fade into the background of McPherson\u2019s overall body of work, which stands as one of the greatest seasons by a kicker in Bengals history, and one of the best by a rookie in league annals,\" The Athletic's Jay Morrison said. Simmons added that McPherson would need to improve his kickoffs this offseason. McPherson finished his rookie year with the ninth most field goals (29) and the ninth most attempts (34), drilling five walk-off kicks. No one recorded more field goals of more than 50 yards in 2021. His clutch postseason kicks and cockiness made McPherson something of a household name. He'll likely be the first kicker off draft boards in 2022.\u00a0\n",

The Bears were simply overjoyed by Santos' competent 2020 after years in the kicker wilderness. Santos converted 93.8 percent of his 2020 field goal tries, boosting his career mark to 83.1. Santos is not called on very often from 50-plus yards, making him an extra unlikely recipient of this kind of contract. There's a chance this deal could quickly become an albatross.\u00a0\n",

He made every one of his extra-point attempts in 2019 and 2020, missing just one PAT in 2021 (57-of-58). One of the brightest moments of Brkic's career came when he tied an FBS single-game record with three field goal makes of at least 50 yards (51, 56, and 55) along with a 26-yard make in the season opener vs. Tulane. He will push Greg Joseph, who is due a non-guaranteed RFA tender amount of $2.433 million.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Fantasy football's No. 2 kicker in 2020 is cashing in on a profoundly efficient season in which he made 36 of 39 field goal attempts, banging through all 36 of his extra point tries. He established himself as one of the league's big-footed kickers by nailing eight of nine kickers over 50 yards. Sanders' extension includes a $10 million guarantee. His 2020 numbers stand in stark contrast to his 2019 stats, which include seven missed field goals on 30 attempts. Only the Cowboys and Falcons attempted more field goals than Miami in 2020, giving Sanders the opportunity necessary to become a waiver wire darling in fantasy. Sanders will probably be one of the most over-drafted kickers in fantasy football next season.\u00a0\n",

Washington must have liked what they saw in Slye's six games with the team last season. He made all 12 of his field goal attempts and all ten of his extra points after stints in Carolina, Houston, and San Francisco during the 2021 season. In his first two NFL seasons, he made a middling 79.4 percent of his field goal tries. Slye, who has never missed arm day, has long been excellent on kickoffs. Perhaps Slye, 26, can find a long-term home with the Commanders.\u00a0\n",

We'll get more information on Surtain's Week 3 status throughout the week, but it sounds like he's already trending in the right direction.\n",

ESPN's Adam Schefter reported on Sunday that it would be \"tough\" for Jackson to suit up tonight, so it would not be surprising were he on some sort of snap count. Either way, his presence is a major boost for a unit that was actually looking much improved on last year's unit in Week 1, thanks in large part to Khalil Mack's ominous presence opposite Joey Bosa. Inactive for the Chargers are\u00a0WR Keenan Allen, TE Donald Parham, RB Isaiah Spiller, DL Christian Covington, DB JT Woods, OL Brenden Jaimes and QB Easton Stick.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Kearse was injured while tackling Leonard Fournette in the third quarter of Week 1. He does not have a specific timeline as of yet, but ESPN's Todd Archer notes that this is typically a 2-4 week injury. Kearse struggled before exiting and was replaced by Donovan Wilson who was a capable fill-in. The Cowboys should be able to hold up on defense without Kearse for a few weeks.\n",
