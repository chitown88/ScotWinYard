    "analysis": "Baltimore's offense is ice cold, scoring a grand total of five touchdowns over its past four games. Jackson ran for his life from start to finish in Week 13 behind an overmatched Baltimore offensive line. He was sacked seven times and barely avoided a handful of other sacks, sometimes turning those into miraculous gains. Jackson forced a few first half throws into tight coverage, one of which was picked. His only touchdown came in the game's waning moments as he found Sammy Watkins near the back of the end zone to cut the Pittsburgh lead to one. Jackson then threw too wide to Mark Andrews on a failed two-point conversion. Jackson's role as the team's primary ball carrier is a massive boost for his weekly fantasy floor, but it's been a while since he's filled up the stat sheet. Jackson gets the Browns next week, two weeks removed from throwing four interceptions against Cleveland.\u00a0\n",

New England called just three pass plays all night, but the Bills tried to stick to their identity. It just didn't work, as passes sailed and timing was way off. Allen should have had a 44-yard touchdown to Stefon Diggs, but Diggs had the deep ball bounce off his arms in the end zone. Allen's one touchdown pass was a 14-yarder to Gabriel Davis in the first quarter on a quick slant. Allen tried to create magic all night but was his typical erratic, all-over-the-place self. Allen and the Bills have a mouthwatering fantasy date with the Bucs next week in Tampa Bay. Giddy up.\n",

Murray also helped prove DeAndre Hopkins' good health with his best throw of the day, a 20-yard touchdown strike in the first quarter where only body-control maestro Hopkins could get it. Murray looked dangerous with his legs, with his rushing scores coming from nine and three yards out.

He only engineered one touchdown drive, which he capped off by scampering into the end zone himself. His one interception wasn\u2019t a great throw, but it did ricochet off the hands of Tyreek Hill before falling into Patrick Surtain\u2019s arms. That was a theme tonight, as multiple Chiefs struggled with drops. Despite the mediocre performance, Mahomes remains a strong fantasy option moving forward. He gets the Raiders in Week 14.\n",

It's possible that he is able to make it back before the team faces the Bears on Sunday. If he can't, Kurt Benkert will serve as the team's QB2. Players who test positive for COVID are then exempt from normal virus testing for 90 days and do not have to quarantine as close contacts. This means Aaron Rodgers' status for Week 14 will be unaffected.\u00a0\n",

The tides turned out of the locker room as Cooper Kupp took over with a 43-yard gain on the Rams' second play in the third quarter and 4/99/1 total in that 15-minute stretch. Stafford also connected with Van Jefferson (6/41/1) and Odell Beckham (2/28/1) for touchdowns before being rested in the fourth quarter. The veteran quarterback notably left for one play after a hard tackle in the second half but returned quickly. Snapping their three-game losing streak in this one, the Rams travel to Arizona for a crucial divisional showdown under the lights in Week 14.\n",

Brady's lone blunder \u2014 a three-yard pick-six in the final minute of the first half \u2014 was his fifth consecutive game with an interception.

Brady\u2019s\u00a034 passing touchdowns are also tied for the eighth-most through 12 games in league history.

Not expected was the Titans' ground-game resurgence, with D'Onta Foreman and Dontrell Hilliard, keying an attack that went 39/270/1. The problem was fumbles, with the Titans giving away three of them. That did not include Tannehill, though his interception was an end zone tip job that basically ended any shot the Titans had of making a comeback in the fourth quarter. The score that Tannehill did convert was a one-yard strike where Nick Westbrook-Ikhine staggered his way into the painted area. The Titans are getting a desperately-needed bye in Week 13, though A.J. Brown will be ineligible to suit up for Week 14 vs. Jacksonville. We would believe Julio Jones when we see it.\u00a0\n",

Mayfield wasn't awful against the Ravens on Sunday night, throwing for 247 yards and a touchdown in another offensive struggle for Cleveland. Since Week 10, Mayfield has completed 44 of 87 passes (50.5 percent) for 496 yards (5.7 yards per attempt), three touchdowns, and three interceptions. Pro Football Focus grades Mayfield as the 26th best passer this season, below QBs like Andy Dalton and Carson Wentz. The Browns have the league's ninth lowest expected points added (EPA) per drop back over their past three games. Cleveland's offense couldn't possibly be worse with Keenum at the helm.

Then the wheels came off in Week 12 as he was intercepted twice while throwing for 4.4 yards per attempt. Newton was benched for P.J. Walker before the game ended. His matchup with the Falcons is undoubtedly an easy one and he also adds plenty of fantasy production with his legs. The downside risk of getting benched remains high for the tenuous starter. If he makes it through four quarters, Newton should be able to amass QB1 numbers through his rushing output alone.\n",

Although he took only two sacks, Carr faced a torrent of pressure, and had trouble sustaining drives, especially in the first half. Things did finally open up after the break, with Carr really working his connection with Hunter Renfrow (9/102). Unfortunately, he also had to work his connection with Zay Jones because of the Raiders' lack of bodies at pass catcher, and it resulted in a number of \"almost\" plays. With only two touchdowns over his past three starts, Carr has seen his floor collapse amidst his supporting cast limitations. Although he will probably be in Week 14 chase mode in Kansas City, Carr will be merely a mid-range QB2.\u00a0\n",

Had Everett secured that pass, Wilson's stat line would look flawless. Wilson has yet to top 250 yards since returning from his finger injury but he looked close to normal in this game. Wilson's second score of the day was a vintage floater to Tyler Lockett from 12 yards out. The Seahawks still made plenty of strategic errors, including opting to run the ball on second and 43 (not a typo). Wilson followed that up with a throw well short of the sticks to Tyler Lockett. Seattle's 1970's brand of football remains a thorn in Wilson's side but he at least showed some QB1 juice today. He'll be in the QB1 conversation in Week 14 versus Houston.\n",

Garoppolo's final pass of the day was deflected at the line of scrimmage and fell harmlessly to the ground. The veteran quarterback made a handful of nice throws but his day was also underscored by two interceptions, an egregious underthrow a poor overthrow. Garoppolo has put together a solid season despite all of the hype for his team centering around his backup. Still, at 6-6, now clinging onto the seventh seed in the NFC, there will certainly be calls for Trey Lance to see more snaps going forward. Until things get dire for the 49ers, expect Kyle Shanahan to stick with Garoppolo for the foreseeable future. Gaoppolo checks in as a mid-QB2 heading into his Week 14 matchup with the Bengals.\n",

But as soon as the team was forced off script, down by two scores, things went sideways for the rookie and his offense. Even from clean pockets with open pass catchers, Wilson often missed badly -- mostly high throws that sailed for picks or almost-picks. The Jets could not deploy the hyper-conservative offense that delivered Wilson's second pro win last week against the terrible Texans. Garbage time production helped Wilson clear the 200-yard mark for the first time since Week 4. He's off the fantasy radar for Week 14 against New Orleans.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Atlanta opened the game hot from the ground, moving the ball with a 39-yard run from Cordarrelle Patterson and 17-yard touchdown from Mike Davis. That's where it ended as their offense failed to reach the end zone for the rest of the game, benefitting from a pick-six at the three-yard line for points. Ryan's pass protection (or lack thereof) was the difference as the Bucs lived in Atlanta's backfield for 10 quarterback hits and five sacks, three that killed multiple drives on third down. The Falcons have now gone 0-7 at Mercedes Benz Stadium since November 29, 2020, more than a full calendar year without a win at home. The Panthers' pass rush could prove to be a problem for Ryan in Week 14.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "It was Goff's first three-touchdown game since his garbage time-induced Week 1 against the Niners, and it was just his fifth multi-touchdown game of the season. The 296 yards were his third-most of the year. Goff played great in the first half but was dreadful for much of the final 30 minutes, but Goff did manage to get the Lions down the field in the final 1:50 to throw an 11-yard touchdown to Amon-Ra St. Brown as time expired to give the Lions their first win of the season. Goff will go to Denver in Week 14 as one of the worst fantasy quarterback options week in and week out.\n",

They are also one of the few opponents that the Saints should be able to soundly defeat regardless of who they have at quarterback, as Gardner Minshew reiterated in Week 13. Kamara would slot in as an RB1 this week, even while likely splitting touches to some degree with Mark Ingram.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Hilliard was targeted only twice, catching a two-yard pass. Hilliard now 19 carries for 166 yards (8.73 YPC) since first seeing action off the practice squad last week, but his fumble today was a back-breaker, costing the Titans at least three points near the end of the first half. Hilliard was at the end of a 32-yard run when\u00a0Davon Godchaux simply grown man'd the ball out of his hands. Hilliard did save face when a simple, clock-killing draw call somehow turned into a 68-yard touchdown at the 0:37 mark of the second quarter. Backfield mate D'Onta Foreman also cleared 100 yards and lost a fumble as the Titans finally got their post-Derrick Henry rushing attack on track. Coach Mike Vrabel has a week to think about it with the Titans headed on bye, but we would expect a similar two-headed approach vs. the cellar-dwelling Jaguars in Week 14. Despite today's nonexistent receiving performance, Hilliard should probably help out in that department moving forward. He is a viable FLEX.\u00a0\n",

He left the game limping and Justin Jackson cleaned up on the final drive. However, the game had long been decided, so it's tough to tell how serious the issue was. If he's healthy, Ekeler should have no problem posting another RB1 game versus the Giants next week.\n",

    "analysis": "Williams was brilliant in a game in which the Broncos couldn\u2019t get a whole lot going. In fact, the North Carolina product led the team in targets with nine. He caught a dump-off from Teddy Bridgewater in the fourth quarter and basically walked into the end zone, the lone offensive touchdown for Denver. Williams flashed fantastic tackle-breaking ability all night long. With that being said, Williams\u2019 fantasy ranking depends heavily upon Melvin Gordon\u2019s status. Consider the rookie a high-end RB1 against the Lions next week if Gordon is out, but he would fall into RB2 territory if the veteran returns.\n",

Jones will get the Packers' Week 13 bye to rest his injured knee and return in Week 14 against the Bears. He should be a RB2, barring any setbacks with his MCL injury.\u00a0\n",

Jamaal Williams, after setting season highs in snaps and carries last week against Chicago, will take over as Detroit's RB1. He should get all the work he can handle, including pass-catching opportunities from checkdown master Jared Goff. No team has targeted running backs at a higher rate than the Lions (29 percent) through 12 weeks. Williams goes against an injury-plagued Minnesota front seven that has allowed the highest rushing expected points added (EPA) over the past five weeks. Williams is locked in as a RB2 option against the Vikings.\u00a0\n",

Simply stunning. This is now at least the second time this year Meyer has pled ignorance about his backfield's usage, as if he were not the man in charge. The legendary college football coach has seemed in thoroughly over his head in Jacksonville, with his offense collapsing instead of improving as the season wears on. A supposed offensive genius, Meyer's team has 64 points in six games since Jacksonville's bye. That is ridiculously awful. It seems fair to say Meyer is going to need to completely revamp his process if he's back for a second season in Duval.\u00a0\n",

He averaged fewer than three yards per carry and gave up a fourth-quarter fumble that was returned for a touchdown, essentially ending the Bengals' hopes at manufacturing a comeback. Mixon also failed to reel in a reception on his lone target. Despite the lackluster outing, Mixon remains firmly in the top-five fantasy running backs going forward. With at least one touchdown in all but two games this year, Mixon can be trusted as an RB1 versus the 49ers next week.\n",

Gibson nevertheless offset his lack of efficiency with sheer volume, taking the ball 25-plus times for the third time in four contests since Washington's bye week. Gibson's score was a four-yard strike where he simply raced to the spot and beat the defender to the front right corner of the end zone. Gibson is rarely reaching 4.0 yards per carry in any given contest, but 20-plus totes have become a given. Gibson's pass-catching floor will be hollowed out a bit if J.D. McKissic (concussion) returns for Week 14 against the Cowboys, but he will be a high-end RB2 even if McKissic suits up.\u00a0\n",

    "headlineNews": "Panthers placed Christian McCaffrey (ankle) on injured reserve, ruling him out for the remainder of the season.\n",
    "report": "",
    "analysis": "McCaffrey has already been on injured reserve once this season due to a hamstring injury. Players who are put on injured reserve a second time are not allowed to return, meaning this second stint ends his 2021 season. McCaffrey suffered the ankle injury in his fourth game back from the hamstring issue. He appeared to roll his ankle in the first half of his Week 12 game versus the Dolphins and did not return in the second half. It was previously reported that an x-ray did not reveal any serious issues and that McCaffrey might have been able to return after the team's Week 13 bye. Further testing obviously revealed the injury to be much worse, but the Panthers are also fourth in their division and trending in the wrong direction with no capable quarterback on the roster. Giving McCaffrey the rest of the season to get ahead on rehab makes sense for a team that is likely looking toward the future. ESPN's David Newton added that he won't need surgery and should be ready for the 2022 season. Chuba Hubbard averaged 21 touches for 83 yards in his five starts earlier this year. He'll slot in as a volume-based RB2 once the Panthers return from their bye. McCaffrey's season ends with 442 rushing yards and 343 receiving yards across seven games. When healthy, he remained the best fantasy option in the league. After playing just 10 games over the past two years, his health is no longer a given. Expect him to be drafted early in the first round of fantasy drafts next year, although the days of him as the 1.01 may be over.\n",

It was one of the plays of the day for the Cardinals, as Conner snagged a high pass with one hand, made a defender miss, and was off to the races for a 23-yard TD. Conner's good touchdown fortune also finally caught up to him up a bit, as he thwarted on a number of goal line carries, including back-to-back totes from the Bears' one-yard line in the fourth quarter. With Chase Edmonds (ankle) seemingly finally returning for Week 14 against the Rams, Conner might return to touchdown-based RB2 instead of the high-end option he has been in recent weeks, but he will remain a must start.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "This was the fear after Drake got his ankle pinned underneath him in ugly fashion on Sunday afternoon. Drake also dealt with ankle issues in 2020, though this was not an \"injury prone\"-type of issue. This was \"a grown man just fell on my ankle\"-type of issue. Drake had been more involved in the Raiders' offense since Jon Gruden's firing/Henry Ruggs' release, though he was still rarely seeing more than 10 handles per game. The biggest fantasy impact of his injury is going to be the extra targets it sends Josh Jacobs' way. Jacobs caught a career-high nine balls on Sunday, though that was with Jalen Richard on the COVID-19 list. It's possible the lifer passing-down back Richard starts claiming some third-down reps in the highly-paid Drake's absence. One month shy of his 28th birthday, Drake's bloated salary includes $5.5 million in 2022 guarantees, so he will be back in Vegas with his 53-man roster spot intact. Considering his age, role, and now this injury, however, he doesn't have much of a Dynasty league future.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Elliott's stunning lack of elusiveness was on full display Thursday night against New Orleans. Reportedly hobbled by a bruised knee he suffered in Week 4, Elliott was again slow and ineffective on his 13 carries for 45 yards. PFF rates him as the tenth least elusive running back in the NFL this season, comparable to backs like David Johnson, Carlos Hyde, and Latavius Murray. For context, Dalvin Cook has forced 37 missed tackles on 172 carries this season and Nick Chubb has forced 41 missed tackles on 150 attempts. Tony Pollard, who had another long touchdown run in Dallas' win over the Saints, has forced 23 missed tackles on 100 carries. Pollard has the 13th highest breakaway percentage, per PFF, while Zeke is 37th in breakaway rate. Pollard drafters can only hope rational coaching takes hold in Dallas and Elliott is used as a 1B back behind Pollard as the team's 1A down the regular season's final stretch. We wouldn't bet on it though.\u00a0\n",

Qadree Ollison was rumored to be more involved in his first game post-injury but Patterson notably out-touched him 16-3. The latter remains a borderline RB1 in Week 14 against the Panthers.\n",

    "headlineNews": "Alexander Mattison rushed 22 times for 90 yards and one touchdown in the Vikings' Week 13 loss to the Lions.\n",
    "report": "",
    "analysis": "He added three catches for 34 yards on three targets. It was a slow first half for Mattison, who went to the break with 51 scoreless yards on 10 touches. But the Vikings got him going after the half, and Mattison found the end zone from eight yards out in the third quarter. Mattison was stuffed at the one later in the fourth frame, but 25 touches and 134 total yards with one score is more than enough for fantasy players. Mattison has touch counts of 32, 32, and 25 in Dalvin Cook's three missed games this season. With Cook expected to miss at least one more game, Mattison will again be an RB1 next week against the Steelers.\n",

Seattle signed Peterson partially because of a slew of injuries they were dealing with at running back but it was also clear that they were looking for better production from their backfield. While Peterson, who averaged 1.5 yards per carry in his debut last week, isn't going to give them improved numbers, he will serve to turn the backfield into a committee. No Seattle running back can be trusted as a fantasy option in Week 14, despite the juicy matchup.\u00a0\n",

The Saints featured Taysom Hill on designed runs and played from behind the entire game, leaving Ingram without a role. This should be Ingram's last game as the Saints' starter with Alvin Kamara (knee) likely returning in Week 14. Kamara's presence and\u00a0Hill cutting into his touches makes Ingram no better than a low-end RB3 for Week 14 against the Jets.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Elliott's stunning lack of elusiveness was on full display Thursday night against New Orleans. Reportedly hobbled by a bruised knee he suffered in Week 4, Elliott was again slow and ineffective on his 13 carries for 45 yards. PFF rates him as the tenth least elusive running back in the NFL this season, comparable to backs like David Johnson, Carlos Hyde, and Latavius Murray. For context, Dalvin Cook has forced 37 missed tackles on 172 carries this season and Nick Chubb has forced 41 missed tackles on 150 attempts. Tony Pollard, who had another long touchdown run in Dallas' win over the Saints, has forced 23 missed tackles on 100 carries. Pollard has the 13th highest breakaway percentage, per PFF, while Zeke is 37th in breakaway rate. Pollard drafters can only hope rational coaching takes hold in Dallas and Elliott is used as a 1B back behind Pollard as the team's 1A down the regular season's final stretch. We wouldn't bet on it though.\u00a0\n",

Dillon dominated backfield snaps and targets on a decidedly inefficient day in which he was asked to salt the game away with a series of tough runs. Aaron Rodgers checked down to Dillon near the goal line for his lone touchdown against LA. Dillon was not the fantasy superstar many thought he would be during Jones' time away from the team, and the two backs will probably be close to a 50-50 split when the Packers return from bye against the Bears in Week 14.\u00a0\n",

Foreman's giveaway came with the Titans trying to stay in the game down 19-13 early in the third quarter. Foreman was at the end of a 30-yard thumper when J.C. Jackson punched the ball out from behind. It was an unideal development, to put it mildly. Ideal was Foreman and Hilliard finally stabilizing the Titans' post-Derrick Henry rushing attack as Tennessee managed 39/270/1 on the ground. The fumbles were simply killers, each costing the Titans points. We would nevertheless expect a similar approach when the Titans come off bye in Week 14 against the pathetic Jaguars. Foreman will be a high-floor FLEX for that one.\u00a0\n",

Moss out-targeted Singletary 3-0, and Matt Breida was a distant third with just two touches on the night after muffing a handoff early that led to a turnover. It may have been enough to get Moss back in the good graces of the coaching staff, but none of these backs can be trusted when all three are active. The Bills go to Tampa Bay in Week 15. It won't be a Moss game.\n",

While Peterson, who averaged 1.5 yards per carry in his debut last week, isn't going to give them improved numbers, he will serve to turn the backfield into a committee. No Seattle running back can be trusted as a fantasy option in Week 14, despite the juicy matchup.\u00a0\n",

The veteran speedster was partially to blame for Patrick Mahomes' interception, as an admittedly high throw hit him in the hands and then fell right to Patrick Surtain. On the whole, it wasn't a great night for the Chiefs' passing game, so fantasy managers shouldn't overreact to one disappointing game from Hill. This aerial attack largely revolves around Hill and Travis Kelce, and both should bounce back in a divisional showdown against the Raiders in Week 14. Hill remains a WR1 despite a down week against Denver.\n",

Diggs' 51 yards were a game-high, though he should have had more but dropped a potential 44-yard touchdown deep shot that hit him in the arms in the end zone. The wind gusts surely played a role, but Diggs would say he should've caught the pass. Diggs has at least 51 yards and/or one touchdown in every game this season. He has a ceiling spot next week in a shootout spot against the Bucs in Tampa Bay as a surefire WR1.\n",

Samuel missed the team's Week 13 loss to the Seahawks with a groin injury, one of several soft tissue injuries that have plagued Samuel since the start of the 2020 season. Unless he's able to get in a limited practice on Thursday or Friday, Samuel will have little chance of suiting up against Cincinnati. The Niners offense isn't nearly as potent without their centerpiece, though Samuel's absence should continue to open up targets for George Kittle and Brandon Aiyuk. Kittle commanded a 40 percent target share against Seattle with Deebo sidelined.\u00a0\n",

Jefferson's touchdown came from three yards out late in the fourth quarter to put the Vikings up 27-23 with 1:50 to play. Jefferson has been on a tear of late, with three 100-yard games in his last four outings and four touchdowns over the last five weeks.

For better or worse, Gage should be considered an opportunity-based WR4/5 for the fantasy playoffs until/unless Ridley returns.\n",

With Jeudy out of the lineup, Courtland became a target monster, commanding a 25.7 percent target share in the Broncos' balanced offense. Sutton from Week 2 to Week 7 was fantasy's tenth highest scoring receiver, ahead of highly productive WRs like Justin Jefferson and Chris Godwin. Since Week 8, when Jeudy returned from his ankle injury, Sutton is outside the top-100 highest scoring receivers. His deep ball targets have dried up: In the season's first half, Sutton led the NFL in targets of more than 20 yards downfield (19). From Week 8-13, he's seen the 29th most downfield targets (5). The bleakness knows no ends. Sutton can't be regarded as anything more than a WR4/5 in Week 14 against the Lions.\u00a0\n",

Newton's lone meaningful completion was a 64-yarder to Moore to set up the Panthers' only touchdown. It was actually underthrown after Moore had multiple steps on the defense. With the aid of garbage time, Moore went over 100 yards for the first time since Week 4. He's devolved into a WR2/3 in Carolina's run-oriented offense but remains the team's clear-cut target hog. Moore gets the Week 13 bye before the Falcons in two weeks.\n",

He has also seen his target totals drop in recent weeks. Chase is averaging 5.7 targets per game over the previous three weeks. He was earning 8.1 targets per game through the first nine weeks of his career. Three games is a small sample but Higgins' emergence as an every-week threat has undoubtedly had an impact on Chase. The rookie wideout should be treated as a high-upside WR2 going forward.\n",

Mooney's Week 14 status against the Packers' stingy pass defense will be all about who is healthy. Allen Robinson (hamstring) does not seem particularly close to returning, but it is quite possible Justin Fields (ribs) will be back under center in place of Dalton.\u00a0\n",

That has happened as Washington has gone more established on the ground, though Taylor Heinicke was north of 30 attempts today. McLaurin's three grabs were particularly disappointing in the context of Logan Thomas missing the final frame with a knee injury. 10-plus targets can't be assumed in this run-heavy attack, but Week 14 profiles as an excellent spot for McLaurin to get back on track in what could be a shootout with the Cowboys. Big D loves to surrender big plays.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Jefferson was on the receiving end of one of Matthew Stafford's three passing touchdowns on the afternoon, the former recording a two-yard toe-tap in the end zone for his fifth touchdown of the year. Jefferson has also seen 17 targets in Los Angeles' last two games with Odell Beckham as a full-time player, accruing the second-highest target share (22.4%) on the team behind Cooper Kupp (26.3%) in that span. Jefferson will continue to rank neck and neck with Beckham as high-floor WR2/3s in every game moving forward.\n",

Metcalf could have had a big day but Wilson just missed him on a deep shot down the left sidelined. Had the ball not sailed out of bands, Metcalf could have left Week 13 with a long touchdown. Fantasy managers should keep chasing that upside with Metcalf despite his recent performances. He will be a low-end WR2 versus Houston next week.\n",

Brown was nearly invisible against Pittsburgh's banged-up defense outside of a 22-yard first half catch. His usage as an extension of the run game -- drawing targets at or near the line of scrimmage -- offers Brown a solid weekly PPR floor. Hopefully the big plays will come; Brown has failed to crack the 100-yard mark in five of his past six games. His raw target numbers -- he's seen 56 targets over the past five weeks -- make him a locked-in WR2. He gets the Browns in Week 14.\u00a0\n",

The paltry target total was the function of Kyler Murray attempting only 15 passes in rainy conditions, as well as four Andy Dalton interceptions setting the Cardinals up inside Chicago's 30-yard line. Hopkins' score was vintage, with the body-control legend winning a hand fight with Jaylon Johnson as he sealed off the defender and found the front right corner of the end zone. Despite staring right at the play, the ref initially called Hopkins out of bounds before replay clearly revealed he was in. Provided he avoided setbacks with his troublesome hamstring \u2014 and we didn't spot any \u2014 Hopkins should see a much higher target total in next week's tough home date with Jalen Ramsey's Rams.\u00a0\n",

The rookie came close to two downfield catches as the Jets played catchup in the second half -- receptions that would have put him well over the century mark. Moore's touchdown came on a five-yard first quarter grab in the back of the end zone after Moore had shaken loose from single coverage. Moore has clearly established himself as the team's No. 1 wideout, especially with Corey Davis struggling through a groin injury. He'll be an interesting low-end WR2 play in Week 15 against the Saints.\u00a0\n",

Higgins missed a few games early in the year because of a shoulder injury and returned to post five games without 100 yards or a score. After hitting both of those benchmarks in consecutive games, we're back to deciding whether he or Chase will be Cincinnati's WR1 in a given week. Higgins is a must-play fantasy option for Week 14 versus the 49ers.\n",

With Darren Waller (knee) sidelined, both Renfrow's catch and target totals were new season highs. Renfrow also drew a fourth quarter DPI to set Vegas up for a one-yard Josh Jacobs score. He was a rare fun offensive player to watch in a game that featured lots of pressure and even more rushing attempts. Having now reached seven receptions five of his past six games, Renfrow has locked himself into weekly top-30 status, and will be a WR2 for the right matchups. Week 14 in Kansas City figures to be one such date as the Raiders should have to take to the skies.\u00a0\n",

He made a couple of nice catches, but it was largely a frustrating outing, fueled by poor quarterback play. Glennon nearly threw another interception while looking for Golladay over the middle, but it was a bad throw and not on Golladay. Things got comical when Glennon threw to Golladay in double coverage in the end zone, while the cameraman had already panned to Darius Slayton in single coverage. The Giants clearly want to get Golladay involved, but it's easier said than done given their quarterback play. Golladay will be a flex option in Week 14 against the Chargers.\n",

Already at 82 catches for 949 yards and five touchdowns this year, Godwin needs only five more receptions to reset his career-high in a season and 51 yards to reach 1,000 for the second time in his NFL career. He'll remain a strong WR1 in the team's Week 14 matchup against Buffalo, arguably Godwin's toughest test to date.\n",

With Jeudy out of the lineup, Courtland became a target monster, commanding a 25.7 percent target share in the Broncos' balanced offense. Sutton from Week 2 to Week 7 was fantasy's tenth highest scoring receiver, ahead of highly productive WRs like Justin Jefferson and Chris Godwin. Since Week 8, when Jeudy returned from his ankle injury, Sutton is outside the top-100 highest scoring receivers. His deep ball targets have dried up: In the season's first half, Sutton led the NFL in targets of more than 20 yards downfield (19). From Week 8-13, he's seen the 29th most downfield targets (5). The bleakness knows no ends. Sutton can't be regarded as anything more than a WR4/5 in Week 14 against the Lions.\u00a0\n",

With Mike Glennon at quarterback, both players are risky options, but Golladay is in FLEX consideration due to his redzone role. Toney and Shepard will look to return in Week 14 against the Chargers.\n",

Today was his lowest yardage total in that stretch but he saved an otherwise bland day with a 12-yard touchdown. Lockett is actually two targets behind DK Metcalf in their previous four games but the former has appeared on the same page with Wilson, resulting in his big games. Seattle's offense was mostly functional in this game and gets to face the Texans next week. Lockett can safely be ranked among the WR2s in the easy matchup.\n",

Aiyuk remained a secondary part of the passing attack and that will likely be his role in Week 14, even if Samuel remains sidelined. Fantasy managers can keep starting Aiyuk as a WR3/4 until Samuel returns but it's clear that Kittle will be filling the void he left behind.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Williams experienced swelling in his injured knee and didn't log a single practice this week. Probably fantasy managers won't know Williams' Week 6 status until 90 minutes before game time. In his place, Keenan Allen -- who leads the team in targets -- should see a bushel of looks against a beatable Ravens secondary. Jaylen Guyton or rookie Josh Palmer would absorb some of Williams' opportunities should he sit. Justin Herbert mentioned Palmer when asked about how LA's offense would operate without Williams. \"Josh Palmer has made plays, and he's one of those guys that has worked really hard has picked up the offense very well. We feel really comfortable with him going in there,\" Herbert said. Still, Palmer and Guyton would be desperation WR4 options if Williams is sidelined.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Kirk should have had a second reception, but Kyler Murray badly misfired on what would have been a second half third down conversion. His other missed connection came in the end zone. The bitterly disappointing day was a product of the Cardinals going fully established in awful weather conditions and attempting only 15 passes. Four Andy Dalton interceptions setting Arizona up inside the Bears' 30-yard line also did no favors for Arizona's passing volume. Kirk has mostly kept himself in the WR3 mix, but with DeAndre Hopkins finally back, his floor is going lower and ceiling shakier. Arizona hosts Jalen Ramsey's Rams for Week 14.\u00a0\n",

He accounted for well over half of the entire San Francisco offense and earned a 40 percent target share. A week after catching one pass for 13 yards, Kittle looked as dominant as ever in this game, despite his team ultimately coming up three yards short of tying the game with a few seconds left. Kittle has a good argument to enter Week 14 as the top-ranked fantasy tight end.\n",

With Andy Dalton continually setting the Cardinals up with primo field position, they didn't need to pass, and with rain making the air hazardous, they didn't want to. Ertz's main concern going forward is the return of DeAndre Hopkins, as the two have barely shared the field together in Arizona. With one more mouth for Murray to feed, Ertz will be a mid-range TE2. The Rams are on tap for Week 14.\u00a0\n",

Despite the lackluster outing, Moreau would remain a solid streaming option if he is once again the starter.\u00a0\n",

Howard and Cameron Brate can be dropped to waivers if Gronkowski is indeed back. The Giants, Tampa's Monday night opponent, have allowed an average of 5.33 receptions and 51.1 receiving yards per game to opposing tight ends this year.\u00a0\n",

If he sits again, Moreau will have a shot at redemption against a Chiefs defense that has coughed up the eighth most tight end fantasy points.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "McKeon (6'3/242) made 23 starts across 40 appearances for the Wolverines, missing three games in 2019 with a leg injury. He's typically used his good route running to create separation but lacks the strength to consistently win 50-50 balls through contact. McKeon's receiving production also inexplicably dipped in his final three years at Michigan as he hauled in 31 < 14 < 13 catches from 2017 on. NFL scouts still attest that he's a coachable and reliable teammate, and coach Jim Harbaugh routinely praised McKeon for his fundamental blocking. There are enough skills in the 22-year-old's toolbox to see him stashed on a practice squad while his unimpressive body and build develop.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Smith's recovery timetable is four to five months, which puts his entire 2021 season in doubt. Behind Smith, backup Tyler Conklin has recovered from his hamstring injury and set to play in Week 1. Conklin has a career yards per route run of just 1.0, and is unlikely to deliver a strong fantasy season unless he monopolizes tight end snaps. Conklin's chances of doing that took a big hit when the Vikings traded for Chris Herndon Tuesday. The\u00a0former Jet looked like an emerging star as a rookie in 2018. He was then abysmal in his two seasons under Adam Gase, as is customary. If Herndon can recapture his early career form, the pass-catching tight end could be improbably fantasy relevant this season.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Patterson (5\u201910/181) was a three-star prospect that was rated as the 16th best kicker from the 2017 prep class. The Edwardsville, IL native struggled a bit as a freshman, converting 69 percent of his field goals while registering only two touchbacks on 24 kickoffs. However, Patterson showed consistent year-over-year improvement throughout his career, boosting his conversion rate to 75 percent in 2018 and 92 percent in 2019. In addition to his on-point accuracy, Patterson converted five-of-six attempts of 50 or more yards two seasons ago. His production slipped a bit in 2020, making 15-of-22 attempts, but five of those misses came from beyond the 50-yard threshold, so that should be accounted for. Though he doesn\u2019t possess the most imposing leg in the class, his touchback rate was decent, as 38-of-63 kickoffs were not returned. He will need to iron out his conversion rate if he is going to stick around at the NFL level. The Vikings only have one other kicker rostered, third-year boot Greg Joseph, who has just 20 career field goal attempts. Expect a true kicking completion to take place between Joseph and Patterson if the Vikings don't bring in anyone else.\n",

Carlson converted 94.3 percent of his 2020 field goal attempts after he was a far worse 73.1 percent in 2019. Carlson was 4-of-4 beyond 50 yards last season as he quietly finished as fantasy's fourth highest scoring kicker thanks largely to the NFL's seventh most attempts. He'll likely be overdrafted in seasonal leagues this season. Coach Jon Gruden evidently believes the 26-year-old is his \"kicker of the future.\"\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "The Jaguars had little choice but to cut ties with their kicker of five seasons. Lambo had whiffed on all three of his field goal attempts and two extra points this season. He was inactive in Week 5 against the Dolphins and backup kicker Matthew Wright drilled all three of his field goal tries, including a game-winning kick that temporarily relieved Urban Meyer's suffering. Lambo was once among the league's most accurate kickers, making 71 of his 75 field goal tries (94.6 percent) from 2017 to 2019. Wright shouldn't be considered a reliable fantasy option on a Jacksonville team that generates almost no positive game script. Lambo, meanwhile, has a good shot of landing on another team as a fill-in kicker.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "McPherson, the 149th pick in the 2021 draft, drilled a 50-yarder against Washington in Friday's preseason game -- a kick that would have been good from at least 60 yards. McPherson is the favorite in the team's kicker competition with veteran Austin Seibert, who has also impressed coaches and beat writers this month. The Bengals offense is among the league's most kicker friendly. Last season, Randy Bullock was fantasy's third highest scoring kicker when Joe Burrow went down with a season-ending knee injury. Fantasy managers should consider McPherson if the game's top kickers are off the draft board.\u00a0\n",

The Bears were simply overjoyed by Santos' competent 2020 after years in the kicker wilderness. Santos converted 93.8 percent of his 2020 field goal tries, boosting his career mark to 83.1. Santos is not called on very often from 50-plus yards, making him an extra unlikely recipient of this kind of contract. There's a chance this deal could quickly become an albatross.\u00a0\n",
