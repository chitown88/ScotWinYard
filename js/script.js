His score to Cobb was the highlight, as he rolled out right to buy time before finding Cobb dashing back to the front of the end zone. His strike to Fuller was an uncovered 53-yarder.\u00a0Watson has been back to operating at an elite level for the better part of the past month after his slow start.

    "analysis": "Herbert was the best player on the field in this one, but the Chargers simply couldn't hang on to a 20-3 lead and eventually fell in overtime. Herbert was electric in the first half, going 9-of-13 for 109 yards and three touchdowns, but he lost Keenan Allen to a second-quarter back injury and was left with just Mike Williams and Hunter Henry. Williams caught four- and 64-yard scores, and Henry secured a red-zone touchdown of his own after Allen caught Herbert's first score from 17 yards away. The Allen touchdown throw was an incredible on-the-move bullet where Herbert escaped the rush. Henry's touchdown was a perfectly-placed out route. Herbert has been great since stepping in as the starter and has particularly excelled under pressure. Herbert will be a QB2 after the bye when the Bolts face the Jaguars.\n",

Hockenson fell backward into the end zone. His interception was tossed in the direction of two leaping linemen. Stafford otherwise played game manager as the Lions easily won on the road. The owner of just nine touchdowns through five starts, Stafford has looked nothing like the aggressive madman he was in the first half of 2019. He's yet to have a 300-yard day and is completing a modest 60.7 percent of his passes. Fantasy managers will hopefully get more in next week's almost-guaranteed shootout with the Falcons.\u00a0\n",

Wentz has now posted three total scores in back-to-back games, finding the end zone with his legs each time out. Despite his impressive size, it can often feel like Wentz is taking his life into his hands with his reckless abandon running, but it's been a badly needed element for the Eagles and fantasy players alike. It is keeping drives alive and defenses on their toes. Tonight's\u00a0359 passing yards were a new season high by 89. Wentz once again targeted Travis Fulgham 10-plus times. The bad news is, DeSean Jackson got hurt just as a quickly as he returned and will almost certainly miss next week's showdown with the Cowboys. The statistics were good, but Wentz still missed too many easy throws this evening. Life won't be getting any easier behind the Eagles' injury-ravaged line, but his golden Week 8 matchup will have him in the low-end QB1 mix.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Ryan was in an 11-quarter\u00a0touchdown drought when he found Julio Jones for a first-quarter touchdown. Jones was the missing ingredient for the entire Falcons offense in recent weeks. He adds way more big-play potential and allows more room for ancillary pieces to operate. Ryan's best play was a scramble on 4th-and-1 that resulted in a flick to Jones for a 40-yard run-and catch. When Ryan, Jones, and Calvin Ridley are fully healthy, Ryan can be jammed inside top-12 fantasy rankings. That should be the case at home next week with Detroit traveling south.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Brees was the subject of many Twitter jokes in the first half as the Saints failed to move the ball much at all against the Bolts' defense. Brees couldn't complete anything more than a couple yards downfield and had some truly horrific throws, including an INT right to S Nasir Adderley. But the Saints found a bit of a groove after halftime and were able to erase a 17-point deficit. Brees' touchdown was a 41-yard hookup to Jared Cook, and he also rushed for a one-yard touchdown on a QB dive at the goal line. Brees has lost a lot as a thrower in recent years and has settled in as more of a QB2 for fantasy ahead of a Week 7 date with the Panthers following the bye.\n",

For fantasy, it will be difficult for Brown, Chris Godwin, and Mike Evans to see sustained production unless Brady turns into a true MVP candidate for the rest of the season. Brown's upside, however, is undeniable, making him at least a\u00a0WR3/flex option once he gets his feet wet in the new system. Mr. Big Chest will have to keep his head on straight to make this signing pay off.\n",

    "analysis": "Mahomes started off looking a bit shaky in the rain. There was a steady rainfall to start the game and it appeared to be affecting both Mahomes and Josh Allen. Mahomes\u00a0missed on two of his first three throws and the Chiefs' initial drive ultimately stalled out at midfield. However, he came back with a vengeance after the first drive. Mahomes missed the mark on just two attempts in the second half and connected with Travis Kelce for two touchdowns. After a lackluster performance in his Week 5 loss to the Raiders, Mahomes was in peak form on Monday night. He remains one of the best fantasy quarterbacks in the league heading into his Week 7 matchup with the Broncos.\u00a0\n",

Allen simply struggled to make tight-window throws and looked like his 2019 self. For fantasy managers, his two scores and 42\u00a0rushing yards on eight carries saved an otherwise quiet day. He remains a QB1 because of his rushing prowess and high touchdown rate. He should have no problem rebounding versus the lowly Jets defense next week.\n",

Watt, and Tannehill got crunched\u00a0on third down. Other than that, it felt like one big gain after another, including a pair of scores to A.J. Brown. Tannehill found backup TE Anthony Firkser for 8/113/1 after Jonnu Smith was forced out with an ankle injury. The Titans like to limit Tannehill's attempts, but he was more than capable of keeping up in shootout ball. After facing Romeo Crennel's swinging gate defense, Tannehill does have a much tougher Week 7 assignment in the Steelers.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

He remains a desperation play in Superflex formats and shouldn't come close to a starting lineup in standard leagues.\n",

The G-Men would have been close to being able to run out the clock. Engram was also the culprit on Jones' interception, allowing the ball to clang off his hands.\u00a0Jones butchered his best play of the night, breaking free for a would-be 88-yard touchdown run on a read option in the third quarter only to face plant at the eight-yard line. Thankfully for the Giants, they were able to score four plays later. Jones now has three touchdowns over his past two games after going four weeks without a score, but he still isn't making enough plays for his moribund team. The Bucs are a highly concerning Week 8 matchup.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "The Raiders fell in a quick 14-3 hole at the start of the second quarter, but Vegas' defense completely shut down Patrick Mahomes for nearly the entire second half, and Carr did his best Mahomes impression in the second quarter. He tossed 59- and 72-yard touchdowns to Nelson Agholor and Henry Ruggs and mixed in a five-yarder to Darren Waller. The teams were knotted at 24-24 at halftime. Josh Jacobs scored a pair of touchdowns on the ground in the fourth frame to seal the win. Carr now has back-to-back 300-yard games and multiple touchdowns in four straight outings. Ruggs' return to the lineup really opens up the offense. The Raiders now have their bye week before a Week 7 date with the Bucs. Carr is still just a middling QB2 in fantasy.\n",

    "analysis": "Dalton didn't instill any confidence in Cowboys supporters in his first start following Dak Prescott's season-ending broken ankle. The bad throws were too many to even count, and Dalton couldn't move the ball despite his elite wideout trio, instead checking down to Ezekiel Elliott for a team-high 11 targets. The Dallas offensive line has been wrecked by injuries, but Dalton did nothing to help them out. A late-game goal-line sequence was littered with laughably off-target throws before he finally hit Amari Cooper for a short, meaningless touchdown to bring the score to 38-10. Dalton will have better days, but it's clear he's not going to be anything like Prescott. Things should be a little easier next week at Washington, but the Football Team defense is probably a better one-for-one fantasy play.\n",

This was Kamara's fourth straight 100-yard game and his first touchdown-less outing of the season. He's been incredible in the absence of Michael Thomas (ankle), but Thomas should be back for Week 7 after the Saints' bye. Kamara gets a date with the Panthers in two weeks.\n",

    "analysis": "\"Limited\" to 20 touches in the Titans' long-awaited return last Tuesday night, Henry entered Week 6 averaging just 3.7 yards per carry. He finally had one of the eruption games he is good for 3-4 times per season, kicking his day into hyperdrive with a\u00a094-yard\u00a0scoring rumble early in the fourth quarter. Henry made a subtle cut at the line of scrimmage, cut back at the second level of the defense and then left the entire Texans defense \u2014 most notably LB Tyrell Adams \u2014 in the dust. Score No. 2 was a walkoff five-yarder in overtime that Henry took on a direct snap. Moments earlier, he added a 52-yard reception on a screen. Henry's only blemish was a number of screens where he could not quite hook up with Ryan Tannehill for what likely would have been big gains. Now with two touchdowns in each of his past three contests, Henry will remain a top-three play for next Sunday's showdown with the Steelers' elite run defense.\u00a0\n",

The NFL can still step in and impose a minor suspension\u00a0at some point. Because Denver was pleased with how Gordon handled himself following the DUI, this also means that a ceremonious ban on the opening drive is likely off the table as well. Gordon did not travel with the team this week because of a non-COVID illness. Expect him to return to his usual RB2 status in Week 7 versus the Chiefs unless the NFL disciplines him in the coming week.\n",

Drake's first touchdown was a one-yard goal-line walk-in in the second quarter, and the second was a meaningless 69-yarder late in the fourth quarter when the Cowboys simply had already given up. It all still counts in the box score, though. Drake has looked bad much of the season, so this was a much-needed breakout. He gets a home date with the Seahawks in Week 7.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "That Week 8 game is a Thursday Night Football tilt, so it appears instead of trying to hurry CMC back for what would be two games in five days, the Panthers are trying to build him back to full strength for a divisional showdown. Although it sometimes feels like Mike Davis has barely missed a beat in McCaffrey's absence, he has been less efficient both as a runner and receiver. Getting CMC back will be a humongous boost for the surprisingly-competitive Panthers, as well as a game changer for the fantasy season stretch run. If you're rostering Davis, treat Sunday vs. the Saints as the last dance.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Singletary was the primary ball-carries in Zack Moss's first game back from a toe injury. The rookie still took five rushes from him but was similarly ineffective. Buffalo's offensive line routinely let defenders get in the backfield so many of Singletary's carries were blown up shortly after the snap. Singletary caught one of his two targets for 13 yards. The Bills should have no problem rolling the Jets in Week 7. A healthy lead should boost the rushing output from Singletary next week but he remains an RB2/3 with Moss stealing work from him.\n",

Kyle Allen's propensity to dump the ball off generated 12 running back targets for Washington but Gibson saw less than half of them. He ceded an additional three carries to Peyton Barber. Gibson will need to see a serious uptick in his role as a pass-catcher or runner if he's going to break out as a rookie. He currently projects as nothing more than an RB3 in PPR leagues.

    "analysis": "Schefter mentioned the teams in a TV report shortly after the Jets released Bell. Vegas signing Bell\u00a0might not be devastating to Josh Jacobs' fantasy prospects, but Bell could eat into his somewhat limited pass game involvement. The same goes for Myles Gaskin if Miami signed Bell. The veteran signing with New England would further muddle a backfield that has been a nightmare for fantasy managers this season. Bell would probably have the most fantasy value if he ended up with the Dolphins, depending on if he has anything left in the proverbial tank.\u00a0\n",

He added that Bell has been staying late to learn the Kansas City playbook. Bell will still play a limited role in the offense with Clyde Edwards-Helaire expected to see the bulk of the work for now. The biggest threat to CEH will be Bell's prowess as a receiver out of the backfield. Bell could push CEH into RB2 territory if he takes away targets from the Chiefs' first-round selection.\n",

    "analysis": "He caught both of his targets for 23 yards in the passing game. The eight carries were actually Murray's second-fewest in a game this season. He'll have big games here and there, but they're difficult to predict. Murray's most value is as insurance for Alvin Kamara managers. The Saints have their bye ahead of a Week 7 date with the Panthers.\n",

It's been clear for some time that Higgins had passed A.J. Green in the Bengals' pass catching pecking order; we might see Higgins emerge as the team's No. 1 wideout in the coming weeks if he continues to command high-value targets. It'll be hard to bench Higgins in 12-team leagues this week against the Browns.\u00a0\n",

Brown and Tom Brady have a relationship dating back years, and Tampa Bay is all in for a 2020 Super Bowl run. For fantasy, it will be difficult for Brown, Chris Godwin, and Mike Evans to see sustained production unless Brady turns into a true MVP candidate for the rest of the season. Brown's upside, however, is undeniable, making him at least a\u00a0WR3/flex option once he gets his feet wet in the new system. Mr. Big Chest will have to keep his head on straight to make this signing pay off.\n",

Kirk probably deserves to be rostered in 12-team leagues, but he still feels extremely volatile. The good news is he gets a juicy Week 7 date with the Seahawks' awful pass defense.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "The final details of the contract have to be finalized and Brown must go through COVID-19 protocols, but Brown is eligible to play as soon as Week 9 according to ESPN's Adam Schefter. Brown and Tom Brady have a relationship dating back years, and Tampa Bay is all in for a 2020 Super Bowl run. For fantasy, it will be difficult for Brown, Chris Godwin, and Mike Evans to see sustained production unless Brady turns into a true MVP candidate for the rest of the season. Brown's upside, however, is undeniable, making him at least a\u00a0WR3/flex option once he gets his feet wet in the new system. Mr. Big Chest will have to keep his head on straight to make this signing pay off.\n",

    "analysis": "It's another low-volume game for Lockett, who caught two passes for 39 yards last week. His five targets were behind both DK Metcalf (11)\u00a0and Chris Carson (7). It's possible these end up Lockett's worst games of the season. Locket gets a matchup with the Cardinals after Seattle's Week 6 bye.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "All it took for Tate to finally do something was for Sterling Shepard to return. Of course, the one-catch effort was Tate's second straight, but what a catch it was. Being blatantly interfered with on the first play of the Giants' second drive, Tate won a game of hand-to-hand combat with Cre'von LeBlanc for his score. Tate also drew a 22-yard DPI on LeBlanc in the fourth quarter. The Giants will take it, but it is not enough to return Tate to the WR4 radar in fantasy, especially ahead of next week's tough matchup with the Bucs.\u00a0\n",

The 31-year-old has now seen at least six targets in three of his last four starts and admittedly looked like his old self in consistently boxing out Green Bay's linebackers and finding holes in the zone on Sunday. With O.J. Howard (torn ACL) done for the year, Gronk remains a TE2 with touchdown upside \u2014 especially if he continues play himself into game shape. Fantasy players can go back to him with confidence in Week 7 against Las Vegas.\n",

That's the list.\u00a0Austin Carr could be called up from the Saints practice squad for this week's game against Carolina. Smith should function as the Saints' WR1 against the Panthers. He's a low-end WR2 based on opportunity alone. Jared Cook could see more targets with Thomas and Sanders sidelined.\u00a0\n",

That was just a warmup for what would come with 2:09 remaining in the game, where Engram dropped a sure first down on a 3rd-and-7, one that would have functionally allowed the G-Men to end the game. It was the continuation of a brutal year for the should-be TE1, one that has seen him held below 50 yards six times in seven games. There has been loose trade chatter, but Engram's value is sitting at an all-time low ahead of next week's showdown with the Cowboys. Despite tonight's mistakes, Engram's target counts and the Cowboys' defensive permissiveness will keep him in the top 16 at tight end.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Hooper was been declared out for this week after undergoing surgery for appendicitis today. NFL Network's Ian Rapoport said Hooper is no sure thing for the team's Week 8 game against Vegas. David Njoku has run more pass routes than Harrison Bryant since Njoku returned to the Browns' lineup two week ago, and has one more target than Bryant over that stretch. We could see a fairly even split between Bryant and Njoku with Hooper out, but Njoku makes for the slightly more preferable waiver wire add for fantasy players in deep leagues and tight end premium formats.\u00a0\n",

Hockenson hasn't reached five catches since Week 1, while his season high for yardage is 62. The floor has proven acceptable in an awful year for the tight end position, but Hockenson needs to demonstrate more ceiling. Perhaps he will finally do so against the Falcons' bottom-barrel defense in Week 7.\u00a0\n",

NFL Network's Ian Rapoport said Hooper is no sure thing for the team's Week 8 game against Vegas. David Njoku has run more pass routes than Harrison Bryant since Njoku returned to the Browns' lineup two week ago, and has one more target than Bryant over that stretch. We could see a fairly even split between Bryant and Njoku with Hooper out, but Njoku makes for the slightly more preferable waiver wire add for fantasy players in deep leagues and tight end premium formats.\u00a0\n",

The Eagles use a lot of two-tight end sets, however, meaning Croom will probably be on the field quite a bit if Ertz and Dallas Goedert are out in Week 7.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Witten spent 16 seasons with the Cowboys from 2003-2019. The most-recent version of the veteran TE wasn't all that great, as Witten set career-low marks in both yards per reception (8.4) and yards per target (6.4) in 2019. The fit with the Raiders is even more puzzling considering the presence of both Darren Waller and Foster Moreau. It's unlikely that Witten sees enough targets and snaps to work as a standalone fantasy option in 2020, but his presence undoubtedly lowers the ceiling of both Waller and Moreau.\n",
