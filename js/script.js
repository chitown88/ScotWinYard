    "analysis": "Rivers' night was about as ugly as his line would imply, even as he had his positive moments. Two of those came on touchdown passes to Hunter Henry and Austin Ekeler in the second and fourth quarter, respectively. However, the lowlights were also in plentiful supply, beginning with a 56-yard pick-six by the Raiders' Erik Harris just past the midway point of the first quarter that extended Oakland's lead to 10-0 at the time. Rivers then failed to notch even a single completion after getting the ball back with 58 seconds and all three timeouts remaining, finishing the possession with an interception that sealed Los Angeles' fate. Rivers now has three multi-interception games this season, and Thursday's 54.8 completion percentage was a season low. He'll look to bounce back with a much more efficient performance in a Week 11 Monday night battle against the Chiefs on Nov. 18.",

The talented passer extended Kansas City's lead to two scores early in the fourth quarter, going airborne within the pocket while delivering a strike to rookie Mecole Hardman for a 63-yard touchdown. Even after the Titans pulled off the improbable comeback, Mahomes responded with a 23-yard completion to Demarcus Robinson to help set up what would have been a game-tying field goal attempt that was ultimately blocked. Any rust Mahomes may have had coming into Sunday appears to be sufficiently shaken off and he'll have eight days to prepare for a reeling division rival, the Chargers, on Monday night.",

    "report": "Jackson completed 15 of 17 passes for 223 yards and three touchdowns and added 65 yards and a touchdown on seven carries during Sunday's 49-13 win over Cincinnati.",
    "analysis": "The Ravens were already up 28-10 midway through the third quarter when Jackson, off of a zone read, twisted and turned up field for a 47-yard touchdown run. He capped off the very next drive with a 20-yard loft to rookie Marquise Brown for his third touchdown throw of the game and the Ravens pulled the dynamic sophomore for the remainder of the blowout. Jackson set a career high for completion percentage in a game in which he threw multiple passes, 88.2 percent, and boasted a perfect 158.3 quarterback rating for the second time this season. Though doubters continue to wait for Jackson to falter, he is humming in Greg Roman's perfectly-tailored offensive scheme. Next up is a Houston defense that has had trouble defending the pass this season.",

    "analysis": "Winston turned in what has become a signature performance for him, one featuring multiple sacks, multiple interceptions and plenty of passing yards. For a change, the Buccaneers were on the right side of the scoreboard by the final gun, as their beleaguered defense was able to come up with a stop on the Cardinals' last-gasp drive. Winston did suffer yet another interception off a deflection, but he also made a bad decision on his first one of the day. The pair of picks pushed Winston's season tally in that category to 14, and Sunday marked his fourth game this year with multiple interceptions. Winston also continued to demonstrate some atypical mobility, breaking free for his second run of at least 20 yards this season and finishing with his second-highest rushing yardage total of the campaign. The embattled 2015 first overall pick will look to clean up the mistakes when he faces an aggressive Saints defense Week 11.",

    "analysis": "Prescott was asked to carry the offense with Ezekiel Elliott getting stuffed with consistency by the Vikings' front. The 26-year-old was able to answer the bell, posting his third-highest yardage total of the season and throwing for three scores for the fourth time this year. Prescott was unable to clinch the victory for Dallas, but his performance was definitely worthy of a winning fantasy squad. We are used to seeing more \"game manager-esque\" stat lines from Dak, so we shouldn't expect near 400-yard performances on the regular. However, he does have a very soft matchup against the Lions (31st against the pass) on tap for Week 11.",

The serviceable outing was enough for Allen to keep the starting job out of the bye week, but he'll need to continue to perform well in his subsequent appearances to hold off rookie second-round pick Drew Lock (thumb). Lock, who has been on injured reserve all season, is slated to practice Tuesday and could be reinstated to the 53-man roster as soon as this weekend to serve as Allen's backup.",

The second-year quarterback isn't much of a factor on the ground, but he could boost his fantasy value by calling his own number more often near the goal line, as this was only Darnold's second career rushing score. He added a 23-yard touchdown pass to Jamison Crowder later in the first quarter. Most importantly, Darnold finished without a turnover. With this much-needed clean performance under his belt following an eight-interception three-game stretch, Darnold's confidence should be climbing ahead of a Week 11 clash with Washington.",

The veteran signal-caller was able to take what the defense gave him, which were short dump-offs to Dalvin Cook (86 of Cousins' 220 passing yards came on screen or swing passes to his running back). Cousins has quashed media criticism by providing more wins for his club of late, but his last three fantasy performances have felt lackluster. We could be in store for more of the same in Week 11 against a Denver defense that can be attacked on the ground but can be tough on opposing quarterbacks.",

    "analysis": "Murray put together the fourth 300-yard effort of his nascent career in the close loss, and he had the Cardinals in the game until the very last play, a last-gasp heave in which Arizona tried to argue for pass interference. Murray had his connection with Christian Kirk in top form, as he hit the second-year wideout for touchdown passes of 33, 69 and 15 yards during the contest. The 2019 first overall pick has multiple touchdown passes in back-to-back games after a five-game stretch where he failed to notch any scoring throws in four contests. Murray will look to continue his development in the fantasy-friendly air raid offense in a Week 11 rematch versus the 49ers.",

    "analysis": "Cook didn't have very many holes to run through against the Cowboys' front seven (3.7 yards per carry), but he was able to put up a huge fantasy line through sheer volume and a trip to the end zone (10th rushing touchdown of the season). The NFL's leading rusher also led his team in receiving, tying his season high of 86 receiving yards. Cook was the clear-cut winner in a star running back showdown with Ezekiel Elliott (63 total yards), and the former is making a strong case for fantasy MVP with 1,415 total yards from scrimmage and 10 touchdowns through 10 contests. Next week's opponent, the Denver Broncos, have a middle-of-the-pack run defense, so Cook should be near the top of the list of projected scores for Week 11.",

    "analysis": "Mack once again dominated the Colts' backfield, with no other back accruing more than three carries. However, he wasn't particularly efficient -- he averaged only 3.9 yards per carry -- and failed to reach the end zone for the fifth time in his last six games. The team's struggle to move the ball effectively as well as Mack's lack of involvement in the passing game continue to limit his ability to turn in big performances. However, volume remains on his side, and that should remain the case as the team heads into its Week 11 contest against the Jaguars.",

Michel averaged 17.5 carries over his previous eight contests, so this game certainly screams outlier. That said, New England had one of the easier schedules during the first half of the season, and it is about to take on four teams after the upcoming bye week that can put up points in bunches. Shootouts tend to favor the pass-catching James White more than Michel, but the latter should continue getting goal-line looks even if his carries take a slight hit in the near future.",

Hill inherited the lead role after Freeman exited late in the second quarter of the Falcons' Week 10 win at New Orleans and went on to amass 61 rushing yards on 20 carries, while also hauling in a 10-yard touchdown pass from Matt Ryan. It was reported by Ian Rapoport of NFL Network that Freeman is expected to be out for about two weeks, providing Hill an opportunity to cash in during a favorable matchup against the Panthers in Week 11, before having to take on Tampa Bay's No. 1 rush defense the following Sunday.",

Coming into his second game back from knee and ankle injuries that forced him to sit out Weeks 7 and 8, Kamara may once again find trouble getting much going as a rusher with the Saints facing off against a Tampa Bay defense that allowed just 37 combined rushing yards to Cardinals running backs Kenyan Drake and David Johnson on Sunday.",

Consequently, Johnson accumulated six touches and 10 yards from scrimmage to Drake's 16 and 41, respectively. There's no telling when Edmonds will be back in action, and Kingsbury gave no indication that Sunday's development will become the norm, but Johnson seems to be losing some sway in the Cardinals' backfield.",

Jones ultimately logged the same number of carries as backfield mate Peyton Barber, however, so it appears Bruce Arians' definition of lead back is a bit more fluid than other coaches. Jones will look for more overall opportunities in a Week 11 matchup versus a tough Saints defense.",

He finished second on the team with seven targets, but he struggled to connect with Josh Allen on several occasions and finished with little to show for his efforts in that area. Singletary did significant damage on 23 touches in his previous outing and could rebound next Sunday in a favorable matchup with the Dolphins.",

    "analysis": "White churned out a rare performance in which he had more of an impact on the ground than through the air. The 27-year-old picked a great time to score his first rushing touchdown of the season, as he was limited to a season-low three targets and two receptions. White popped up on the injury report Friday with a minor toe injury, but he didn't seem to be hampered by the issue. New England suffered its first loss of the season and was playing from behind for most of the contest, which is why its receiving back saw the most touches Sunday. The Patriots had one of the easier schedules over the first half of the season, leaning on its elite defense and ball-control style of offense. Things may change following the upcoming bye week with a slew of high-octane offenses on tap (at Eagles, vs. Cowboys, at Texans, vs. Chiefs). Those types of matchups bode well for White getting more involved in the gameplan.",

    "report": "Ekeler rushed just six times for 19 yards and secured both of his targets for 29 yards and a touchdown in the Chargers' 26-24 loss to the Raiders on Thursday.",
    "analysis": "As his final numbers indicate, Ekeler was held in check on the ground after a strong 12-carry, 70-yard performance versus the Packers just four days prior. However, the versatile back was able to notch a receiving touchdown for the third time in the last four games by snaring a fourth-quarter scoring toss from Philip Rivers, a catch that also helped him extend his season-long streak of multiple receptions to 10 contests. Ekeler will look to up his overall production when the Chargers face off with the Chiefs in a Monday night Week 11 AFC West showdown Nov. 18.",

Not only did he fail to do much with his opportunities, but J.D. McKissic ultimately wound up with 70 percent of the offensive snaps while Perkins (15 snaps) barely saw more than Johnson did before leaving (12). It's possible Perkins could be more involved on early downs if Johnson is forced to miss any time, but it's looking like McKissic is the guy to own in the Detroit backfield in advance of the team's Week 11 game against Dallas.",

Austin Hooper (knee) and Brian Hill each tallied a touchdown catch, but aside from Jones there was not a single Falcon who exceeded 30 receiving yards on the afternoon. Upcoming in Week 11 is the second of five consecutive matchups against NFC South opponents, as Jones and the Atlanta receiving corps face off against Carolina's top-10 pass defense.",

He didn't generate a play longer than 16 yards as he drew plenty of attention from a skilled Buffalo secondary. Meanwhile, Jarvis Landry had another productive game and Kareem Hunt was a notable factor in the passing game, so perhaps opposing defenses won't be able to key in quite as much on Beckham moving forward. He will look to make a greater impact Thursday against the Steelers.",

The final touchdown gave the Cardinals a 27-23 lead midway through the fourth quarter, but Jameis Winston ultimately would lead a six-play, 92-yard game-winning drive for the Buccaneers. Kirk's receiving yardage total also was a career high and served as the second 100-yard game of his career overall. He's curiously alternated single- and double-digit targets across his seven games this year, so he'll look to garner double-digit looks in back-to-back contests for the first time in 2019 when he faces the 49ers in Week 11.",

The 25-year-old has really struggled over his last two contests (four catches for 53 yards combined), so the absence of Adam Thielen (hamstring) is likely leading to more attention being paid to the side of the field Diggs lines up on. The Vikings may stick to a run-first scheme next week against a Broncos defense that has been far more susceptible to opposing rushing attacks, so it could be another low-usage outing for Diggs, especially if Thielen is unable to return to action.",

    "analysis": "Hopkins' one-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter completed the scoring and erased any doubt about this one. The star wide receiver has caught at least eight balls in each of his past four games, totaling 37 receptions over that span. His yardage output wasn't impressive in this one, but Hopkins made up for that by scoring his fourth touchdown of the season. The buy-low window on Hopkins was open during his five-game touchdown drought, but it has long since slammed shut heading into Houston's Week 10 bye.",

Week 10 was an instance of the latter, as Ridley was held under 35 receiving yards with zero touchdowns for the fourth time over his past seven outings. Though he has been inconsistent for stretches of the season thus far, there is reason to believe he will soon see an increase in workload as result of Mohamed Sanu's trade to New England, as well as Austin Hooper's potential absence due to a knee injury suffered Sunday. Despite the probable uptick in volume, Atlanta's upcoming opponent does not present a scenario for Ridley to be re-inserted into lineups with absolute confidence, as the Falcons will be facing off against Carolina's top-10 pass defense in Week 11.",

If a second wide receiver has not emerged in the Saints' passing attack yet this season, one has to wonder if it will ever happen. Outside of Michael Thomas' performance, Sunday's showing was one of the weakest of the year for the New Orleans' receiving corps, as all other Saints wide receivers besides Thomas combined for two catches and 16 yards. Week 11 provides a glimpse of hope for either Smith or Ted Ginn Jr. to be viable as a bye-week fill in, with New Orleans going up against Tampa Bay's bottom-ranked pass defense.",

He'll have a hard time snapping that drought in Week 11 against a stingy and desperate Bears secondary.",

    "analysis": "Hamilton didn't officially log a target, though Brandon Allen did throw his way once in the second quarter on a play that drew a defensive penalty. Still, zero catches in two games without Emmanuel Sanders would have been hard to predict a few weeks ago. Hamilton is WR2 in terms of offensive snaps, ranking second behind Courtland Sutton on Sunday with 32, but Denver has concentrated targets toward Sutton and Noah Fant since Sanders' departure, with 52 percent of the Broncos' targets going to the duo over the past two weeks. What small share Hamilton does have may shrink further after the bye with the impending return of Tim Patrick (hand).",

    "analysis": "Dak Prescott had to air it out for 397 yards on a night where Ezekiel Elliott got shut down (20 carries for 47 yards). The altered gameplan allowed Cobb to get heavily involved and break the century mark for the first time this season. Dallas' slot man has now received eight targets in consecutive weeks, although the eight this week ranked third among Cowboys wideouts behind Amari Cooper (14) and Michael Gallup (10). Next week's opponent, the Detroit Lions, rank at the bottom of the league both against the run and pass, so the Cowboys are likely to get Zeke going first before turning to the air attack in a soft matchup, making Cobb a risky play outside of deeper formats.",

    "analysis": "Sunday's loss was the first time in over a month that Tate was held to under 60 yards. The dynamic sophomore has been targeted at least six times in seven consecutive games and boasts big-play potential, but with Andy Dalton and now rookie Ryan Finley throwing him the ball, he's mostly been held in check this season. Sunday brings a matchup against a weak Raiders pass defense and more conjecture about when A.J. Green (ankle) will return to the field after unsuccessful workouts earlier this week.",

    "analysis": "Andrews capped off the Ravens' opening drive with a two-yard touchdown reception in the flat and then followed up with a 17-yard touchdown up the seam two drives later. The touchdowns snapped a four-game scoreless streak for Andrews, who started the season with three touchdowns in his first four games. Sunday was just the second time in Andrews' last seven games in which he topped 50 yards, as he's struggled with putting together consistent production after a strong start to the season. The Ravens offense, with so many heavy sets and running options, is a tough one to predict, but a favorable matchup does await Sunday against a Houston defense that has been exposed against the pass this season.",

The 24-year-old played all 70 snaps on offense, however, boding well for his continual viability as a fantasy starter in a barren tight-end landscape. With DeSean Jackson looking at an extended absence due to a recurrence of his abdominal injury, the Eagles likely will keep relying on two-tight-end sets after their Week 10 bye, so Goedert still should see consistent chances to produce.",

Knox saw 58 percent of the offensive snaps Sunday and caught four balls for 55 yards on six targets. Kroft can't really be considered the starter at this stage any longer.",
