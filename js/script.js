Progress, but fantasy managers would have been justified in expecting more vs. the Vikings' defense, while the Texans are now 0-4. Playing off his back foot\u00a0the entire game \u2014 the Texans never led and were frequently down two scores \u2014 Watson kept getting saddled with obvious passing situations and took three sacks. He did find Will Fuller for 6/108/1, but aside from Jordan Akins \u2014 who departed with a concussion \u2014 no one else caught more than two passes. Bill O'Brien's commandeering of play-calling duties did not have the desired effect for an offense that is simply flat. Thankfully for Watson managers, he has another plus Week 5 matchup in the Jaguars. Hopefully he can finally have a ceiling day.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Prescott became the first quarterback in league history to throw for at least 450 yards in three consecutive games, moving the Cowboys to 1-2 in that span (and 1-3 on the year). A majority of his yardage Sunday occurred in garbage time as the Cowboys entered the fourth quarter trailing 41-22 and were forced to put their foot on the gas to keep the game competitive. Prescott brought the team within three points, 41-38, with six minutes remaining in regulation but could only watch as Dallas' atrocious defense allowed Odell Beckham to rush for a 50-yard touchdown on an end around on the very next drive. The team's defense (or lack thereof) is clearly a plus for Prescott, who is currently on pace for\u00a0804 attempts, 6,760 passing yards, and 36 touchdowns through the first month of the season. He'll remain an elite QB1 in Week 5 against the Giants.\n",

Fantasy wise, Herbert has vaulted Keenan Allen into fringe WR1 territory, as Allen has a whopping 40 percent target share since Herbert took over. Hunter Henry has also seen a boost, getting nearly 18 percent of the team's targets with Herbert under center. Herbert is\u00a0a top-end Week 5 streamer against the Saints.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "Cousins' 22 attempts were a season low, but it was his best game. Cousins routinely found Adam Thielen and Justin Jefferson for 20-plus yard gains as the Vikings used more pre-snap motion and play-action to breathe life into their offense. It, of course, helped that Dalvin Cook ran all over the Texans' defense. With 25 percent of the season in the books, Cousins has as many passing scores as interceptions (six). We've almost certainly seen his worst stretch of play, but even with Justin Jefferson emerging, there are not going to be many weeks where he's a clear-cut top-18 option. Week 5 happens to be one of those weeks, as the Vikings must head to Seattle to take on the high-flying Seahawks on Sunday Night Football. It will be Cousins' best setup of the entire year.\u00a0\n",

He could have easily had three, but DK Metcalf got wrestled down at the one-yard line on a 32-yard catch late in the fourth quarter. It was Metcalf whom Wilson was targeting in the end zone on his pick, as Xavien Howard simply ran Metcalf's route for him. Despite the \"down\" day in the touchdown department, Wilson's 360 yards were a new season high. With 25 percent of 2020 in the books, MVP frontrunner Wilson is on pace for a mind-boggling 64 touchdowns and 5,140 yards. The former will come down, but the latter could increase. With the way the Seahawks are running their offense, 50 touchdowns is a realistic possibility. The Vikings are yet another Week 5 smash spot for the league's most explosive offense.\u00a0\n",

The Bills find themselves 4-0 and in control of the AFC East for now, especially with Cam Newton on the COVID-19 list. For fantasy purposes, Allen is in the top-five conversation given the Bills' high-end neutral pass rates.

Still, Murray has the skills to save his fantasy football day in almost any game due to his outstanding skills. But from a winning team standpoint, the Cardinals simply could not convert a third down in the first quarter and Murray's overthrows were a part of that. He remains a strong QB1 against the Jets in Week 5.\n",

After going down 14-0 thanks in part to a Brees interception that was tipped at the line of scrimmage, the Saints fired off 35 straight points. Both of Brees' touchdown throws went to Tre'Quan Smith, who has taken over the Thomas role the last three weeks. Thomas may be back as soon as next week against the Chargers where Brees will be a borderline QB1/2.\n",

Through four games, Carr is on pace for 4,380 yards and 32 passing touchdowns. Both of those would be career highs. The Raiders head to Arrowhead for a date with the Chiefs in Week 5.

Even in losing Nick Chubb (knee) for the last three quarters, three separate players (Kareem Hunt, D'Ernest Johnson, Odell Beckham) eclipsed 70 yards on the ground for the Browns. Mayfield has now averaged 25.3 attempts over his last three starts, making Kevin Stefanski's ideal offense (and Mayfield's shaky\u00a0floor) abundantly clear. Expect Cleveland to continue leaning on Hunt against Indianapolis, making Mayfield a droppable option for his lack of volume ahead of Week 5.\n",

Foles missed a number of literally wide-open throws, including arguably the worst pass by any quarterback this season.\u00a0Darnell Mooney was free and clear for a 52-yard score after lighting the ground on fire with an unstoppable route, but Foles missed him by 4-5 yards. Foles did experience the upside of inaccuracy in the second half where one throw was so bad it accidentally created a DPI when the receiver tried to turn back for the ball.\u00a0Despite the miscues, Foles' INT probably should have been caught by Allen Robinson. It bounced off A-Rob's chest into Carlton Davis' waiting hands, who turned it into a 34-yard return. Foles was spotted begging Matt Nagy for more tempo on the sideline, but the duo made a number of dubious clock management decisions in the second half. Foles hasn't been any better than Mitchell Trubisky, but the Bears will not be turning back. The Panthers are on tap for Week 6.\u00a0\n",

With the Bears celebrating, a bewildered Brady thought the play had occurred\u00a0on third down. It was fourth, and Brady quickly stalked off the field to the locker room. Brady looked every one of his 43 years against one of the league's best defenses. The good news is, his supporting cast now has 10 days to get healthy for next week's showdown with the Packers. Things won't be any easier against Za'Darius Smith and company. Brady will be more of a QB2 than QB1.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "This was Bridgewater's best performance in black and blue, remarkably on point and accurate in the intermediate game. Even Bridgewater's 18-yard touchdown run was remarkable, juking and spinning away from multiple defenders near the line of scrimmage to not only convert a 3rd-and-8 but also land in the endzone. His connection with Joe Brady is great, with the lone interception arriving on a sideline shot to Ian Thomas along the right sideline. After everything he has gone through in his career, seeing this kind of game from Teddy B reminds us about the best parts of football. He remains a QB2 against the Falcons in Week 5.\n",

Kamara has been the engine of the Saints' offense since Michael Thomas went down with his high-ankle sprain in Week 1. Thomas is expected back as soon as next week against the Chargers, but Kamara is obviously going to remain a top-three fantasy back from here on out.

Godspeed to fantasy managers who have to start Bell as a RB3 or flex play.\u00a0\n",

That could be the case in Kansas City next week, although the Chiefs have begged teams to run the ball against them for years now. Jacobs, who is on pace for 1,200 rushing yards and 12 rushing touchdowns, will be\u00a0a midrange RB1. His 52-catch pace is solid.\n",

It was a fitting punctuation\u00a0mark to a five-alarm meltdown of a game for both sides. Tonight was Gordon's first 100-yard effort as a Bronco, though he's now reached 70 yards rushing in 3-of-4 appearances. With Phillip Lindsay likely to return for next week's showdown with the Patriots, Gordon will be more of a FLEX than RB2.\u00a0\n",

    "analysis": "With Leonard Fournette (ankle) still sidelined, RoJo had his second 100-yard game on the ground in five days. Jones cleared 50 yards both halves, but he could have had a bigger night had the Bucs not been so penalty prone, especially after the break. Bucs miscues were constantly taking them out of favorable run script even as they played most of the game with a narrow lead. Jones should have had a receiving score near the end of the first quarter, but he was mystifyingly ruled down at the end of a catch he made more difficult than it needed to be. Mike Evans then quickly punched it in for a two-yard touchdown. Jones is complementing his big plays on early downs with just enough mistakes that he cannot be considered safely distanced from Fournette, who should be ready for next week's showdown with the Packers. RoJo will be best utilized as a FLEX for that one.\u00a0\n",

Ekeler was helped off the field Sunday against the Bucs, unable to put any weight on the injured leg. Josh Kelley got nine carries and three receptions in Week 4, while Justin Jackson had eight touches. Kelley is the favorite to lead the backfield in carries for as long as Ekeler is sidelined. Jackson should be picked up this week -- he's one Kelley injury away from seeing a full workload in the LA backfield.\u00a0\n",

Bernard's lone carry appeared to be a four-yard touchdown out of shotgun late in the third quarter, but upon review he was ruled down at the one-yard line. The Bengals are holding back their offense by refusing to commit to Mixon as a three-down back, but there is no reason to expect Bernard's usage to change for the time being. It is not enough to carve out PPR value.\u00a0\n",

Allen will be\u00a0a sure-fire WR1 against the Saints next Monday night. We'll see if CBs Marshon Lattimore and Janoris Jenkins will be active then. They missed Week 4. Through four games, Allen is on pace for a 128-1,302-4 receiving line. PPR gold.\n",

He continues to operate as the clear-cut top target for Josh Allen, who has been a\u00a0rare improver of accuracy. The schedule toughens up for Diggs over the next two months. Hopefully the Titans' coronavirus problem mellows out in the coming days. There's a chance the Bills' Week 5 game is postponed if positive cases continue to pop up.

In yet another turn of fate, Robinson then turned a fourth quarter\u00a0Foles underthrow into a dreadful 19-yard DPI on Davis. The 3rd-and-2 call changed the game. Robinson should find smoother sailing for Week 6 against the Panthers, though Matt Rhule's defense has overachieved through four contests.\u00a0\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "If his fantasy points don't add up, it's because Landry actually tossed\u00a0a 37-yard touchdown pass to Odell Beckham following\u00a0a reverse handoff to put Cleveland on the board first. Landry's involvement from Baker Mayfield was still a disaster as he's now totaled 19 targets (4.7 per game) through the Browns' first four contests. For fantasy players reeling from injuries, Landry is arguably\u00a0droppable in 12-team re-draft leagues. He'll be a low-ceiling WR4/5 In Week 5 against Indy.\n",

Unfortunately for fantasy players, he was dragged down at the one-yard line on a 32-yard grain. Metcalf has yet to catch more than four passes, but he's also yet to catch fewer. With 25 percent of the season in the books, he's on pace for 1,612 yards and 12 scores. The yardage rate will probably come down, but the catches figure to increase. 10-plus TDs is absolutely realistic for a player of Metcalf's size and speed in this kind of offensive attack.

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Only one week after playing limited snaps due to having the \"highest workload of any Cowboys player during camp,\" Lamb bounced back with a 100% catch rate and two touchdowns from the slot. His first touchdown of his career was a wide open 43-yard strike from Dak Prescott after Lamb ran right behind S Andrew Sendejo. Lamb's second score again came opposite Sendejo, beating the veteran in the red zone to bring the Cowboys within three points in the final six minutes. Fantasy players should also note that Cedric Wilson was involved for the second straight outing, totaling six targets as the Cowboys trailed 41-22 entering the fourth quarter. For the time being, Lamb still ranks as a WR3 in the league's most pass-happy attack.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "Sanders entered this one with a pair of sub-20 yards games to his name through three weeks, but the veteran paced the Saints in Week 4 targets and led the team in receiving. It was Tre'Quan Smith who caught both of Drew Brees' touchdowns, however. Sanders has a couple scores already, but there isn't a whole lot of upside here, especially with Michael Thomas (ankle) due back possibly as soon as next week against the Chargers. Sanders is more of a WR4/5 as the fourth or fifth option in New Orleans' offense.\n",

He's averaged 7.8 per game since exploding for 21.5 against the Texans in Week 1. Watkins is a weekly FLEX option since he's always on the field behind Tyreek Hill, but performances like this are par for the course\u00a0and are to be expected. He'll at least have a better on-paper matchup in Week 5 against the Raiders.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "The 49ers passing game ran through Kittle in his first game back from a knee sprain. He also added eight yards on the ground. Kittle's game was nearly perfect but did feature a drop on a two-point conversion in the fourth quarter. A catch would have made it a field goal game. San Francisco finished the game on a failed hail mary. Had Kittle brought down the two-pointer, they may have been able to set up a field goal for the tie. Despite the drop, Kittle looked impossible to bring down and generated yards after the catch at a stunning clip. He's back in contention for the TE1 overall moving forward.\n",

Waller looks like one of the NFL's three best tight ends right now and is a stud in fantasy. Through four games, Waller is on pace for 116 receptions, 988 yards, and four touchdowns on an insane 160 targets. Those target numbers are unsustainable, but he's a top-four tight end in just about every matchup. That will certainly be the case in Kansas City next week.\n",

Part of that is on Carson Wentz, who has played poorly to start the year. Some of Ertz's minuscule fantasy production has to be contributed to his age. He'll be 30 years old next week and his yards per target dropped in each of the past three seasons. The Eagles get a difficult matchup versus Pittsburgh next week. Ertz projects as a low-end TE1 and it's possible that we've simply seen the best of him at this point.\n",

    "report": "",
    "analysis": "The Jets were down to what felt like their No. 99 and 100 receivers, but Herndon was still invisible. One of his two missed connections was a brutal, brutal drop with a little over two minutes remaining. It was a benchable offense. Ryan Griffin drew as many targets this evening. The talent is there somewhere, but with five grabs for 37 yards over his past three games, Herndon is droppable in all formats of fantasy.\u00a0\n",
